For both ABC and CARE, FPGC was open to families from 7:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., 5 days per week and 50 weeks per year.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} Subjects were offered free transportation to and from the center. A driver and second adult staffed each vehicle (one van and two station wagons) equipped with child safety seats.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Data provided by FPGC indicate that approximately 65\% of treated ABC families utilized the free transportation.\footnote{\citet{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost}.} At FPGC, ABC and CARE treatment-group subjects received breakfast, lunch, and a snack planned by a nutritionist.\footnote{ \citet{Haskins_1985_CD, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.}

To promote trust in FPGC within the sample families, staff were recruited from the local community.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Feagans_1996_Childrens-Talk,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Infant and toddler caregivers and preschool teachers demonstrated varied educational backgrounds ranging from high school graduation to master's degrees. Their average professional working experience with young children was 7 years.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} All classroom staff participated in extensive training and were closely observed by FPGC's academic staff, as part of a broad variety of ongoing clinical and social research related to early childhood education, psychology, and health. In ABC, child-caregiver ratios varied by age: 3:1 for infants up to 13 to 15 months of age; 4:1 for toddlers up to 36 months; and 5:1 or 6:1 for children aged 3 to 5 years, depending on cohort size.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach}.} Child-caregiver ratios were similar in CARE.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}
