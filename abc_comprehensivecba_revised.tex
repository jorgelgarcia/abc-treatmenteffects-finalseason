\noindent This paper quantifies the life-cycle benefits of a high-quality early childhood program targeting disadvantaged families. The program was offered as a child development center form of childcare and its net benefits suggest that it should be a prototype for the provision of early childhood education. We forecast the life-cycle benefits and costs of the program by using economic theory to supplement the experimental data generated by the program's randomized design with non-experimental data. Our baseline estimate of the internal rate of return (benefit/cost ratio) is 13.7\% (7.3). We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses to account for model estimation error, forecasting error, and judgments made about the empirical magnitudes of non-market benefits.

\section{Introduction} 

\noindent Vast evidence documents that high-quality early childhood education is effective when provided to disadvantaged children.\footnote{See \citet{Blau_Currie_2006_HEE}, \citet{Duncan_Magnuson_2013_JEP}, \citet{Almond-Currie_2011_JEP}, and \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for surveys.}  Much progress has been done in identifying and estimating gains in short-term outcomes---e.g.,\ cognitive tests and measures of social behavior early in life. In exceptional cases, gains in long-term outcomes such as completed education, health, crime, and labor income have been documented.\footnote{Examples include: \citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}, \citet{Havnes_Mogstad_2011_AEJEP}, and \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}.} A number of studies show that the short-term impact of these programs in socio-emotional skills, rather than in cognition, mediates the gains on long-term outcomes.\footnote{\citet{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor} is the base of this analysis. \citet{Almond_etal_2017_Childhood_UNPUBLISHED} survey other examples.} This evidence is central to current policy debates advocating for early childhood education as a means to promote social mobility.\footnote{On this premise, in the 2015 fiscal year, state-spending on early-education increased in 32 states and rose overall by 12 percent \citep{Parker-etal_2016_50-State-Review}. At the federal level, spending on early childhood education is expected to increase by approximately \$300 million for the 2017 fiscal year \citep{US-Gov_2016_Budget,Smith_2016_Early-Learning-Budget}. Local administrations have had early education as an insignia of effective policy making \citep{Mayor_NY_2014_NYC_ECE-Plan_DOE}.} While the academic and policy debates have largely focused on effectiveness, investment in high-quality early childhood education is only justified if it is \textit{socially efficient}. Surprisingly, the evidence in this regard is rather scarce.\footnote{An exception to this in the economics literature is \citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}, who present a cost-benefit analysis of the Perry Preschool Program. We compare our approach to theirs below. In sum, our approach is more comprehensive in terms of outcomes analyzed and, more importantly, in providing a methodology that could be replicated to assess the social efficiency of any other program.}

In this paper we ask: Is investing in high-quality early childhood education socially efficient? Our estimates indicate that this investment has a per-annum internal rate of return of 13.7\% and a benefit/cost ratio of 7.3 when provided to \textit{socially disadvantaged children}. We provide this answer by analyzing two virtually identical early childhood programs with randomized design conducted in North Carolina: the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE)---henceforth ABC/CARE. Both programs were launched in the 1970s. The programs began early (at 8 weeks of life) and engaged participants until age 5. They were offered as a child development form of childcare. Children developed while they were being treated, while their parents (especially mothers) saw their time constraints relaxed. This caused substantial intergenerational gains (e,g.,\ participants and parents of the participants had a life-cycle gain in labor income due to the program).

ABC/CARE is a prototype of what early childhood education should be (e.g.,\ high staff to child ratios, active monitoring of children, and relaxation of time constraints to single mothers starting form birth) and not necessarily what early childhood is nationwide.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are currently being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on the ABC/CARE approach. The programs are: IHDP in eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start in the U.S. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes (CLIO) study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Current Educare programs in the U.S. are also based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}. Appendix~\ref{app:details-educare} lists around 25 Educare programs, all of which implement curricula based on ABC/CARE.} Own calculations indicate that about 19\% of all African-American children would be eligible for ABC/CARE today (43\% of African-American children were eligible at its inception). Implementation of ABC/CARE on disadvantaged population could be an effective and socially efficient means to promote social mobility.\footnote{For this to happen, similar returns would need to be observed. We provide a contextualization and comment on this issue once we have a complete description of our results in hand in Section~\ref{section:conclusion}.}
 
Intensive data collection on the participants of ABC/CARE have generated what a casual reader could catalogue as an ``ideal'' dataset. We observe longitudinally a set of individuals randomly assigned to treatment and a counterpart group of individuals who were randomly denied access to the program. For both the treatment and the control groups, we observe yearly human capital outcomes from ages 0 to 15. During adulthood, the information is more scattered throughout the years but is rich enough to contain, for example, labor income, a full medical sweep, and administrative criminal records at age 30. This seemingly ideal data, however, does not suffice to provide measures evaluating social efficiency based on the life-cycle benefits and costs that it generates.

The challenge is to identify and estimate life-cycle measures of social efficiency based on the available data, considering that the last available data collection follow-up was when the program participants were in their mid-30s. We forecast the life-cycle benefits and costs of the program by using economic theory to supplement the experimental data generated by the program's randomized design with non-experimental data.\footnote{\citet{Ridder_Moffitt_2007_hbk_metricsdata} provide a discussion of data combination methods. These methods are related to the older ``surrogate marker'' literature in biostatistics (see e.g.,\ \citealp{Prentice_1989_Surrogate_SiM}). That literature does not provide testable predictions to validate the forecasts, which we obtain using structural models.} This allows us to compute internal rates of return and benefit-cost ratios accounting for the large array of benefits and costs that the program generates. Our estimates are robust to extensive examinations of modeling decisions that are necessary when combining data sources

Our approach is the following. We construct a synthetic cohort from non-experimental samples that resembles our experimental sample and use economic theory to identify and estimate invariant (across non-experimental and experimental samples and treatment regimes) production functions of long-term outcomes. The production functions depend of intermediate inputs which we observe and for which we document experimentally induced impacts in our companion paper, \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Ziff_2017_Gender-Diff_UNPUBLISHED}.\footnote{For example, assignment to treatment increased college graduation by 17 percentage points, with a standard error of 5 percentage points and where the college graduation rate for the control group is 12\%. For females, assignment to treatment increased high school graduation 25 percentage, with a standard error of 1 percentage point and where the high school  graduation rate for the control group is 53\% points. These results are the basis of our forecasts: We document that education is actually the main intermediate input when forecasting benefits across the life cycle.} Invariance of the production functions provides us with testable implications that are straightforward to verify empirically. We obtain forecasts by evaluating these production functions on the experimental data; we then adjust for forecasting error.

To preview our approach, consider the forecast of life-cycle labor income. In the non-experimental data, we observe labor income from ages 21 to 67 (assumed age of retirement). We use this data to estimate a labor income function which depends of intermediate inputs (an achievement test, education, and lagged labor income, which are affected by treatment in the experimental data). Invariance of this labor income function makes it a valid means for forecasting.

Note: Panel (a) displays the forecasted life-cycle labor income profiles for ABC/CARE males by treatment status, based on the method proposed in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}. We combine data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (CNLSY79). We highlight the \textit{observed} labor income at $a^*$ (age 30) for the ABC/CARE control- and treatment-group participants. Panel (b) displays the analogous figure for females. Our forecasts go up to age 67, the age of assumed retirement. Standard errors are the respective standard deviations of the empirical bootstrap distribution. See  Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology} for a discussion of our choice of predictors and a sensitivity analysis on those predictors. We under-predict labor income for both males and females. These differences, however, are not statistically significant (and labor income is a relatively minor component of the overall analysis for females).
\end{sidewaysfigure}

In the experimental data, we observe labor income at ages 21 and 30. We evaluate the production function of labor income at age 22 in the experimental data and obtain a forecast. We iterate this procedure up to age 67. At age 30, we observe both a forecast and actual labor income. This provides us with a testable implication: The forecasted and observed level of labor income at age 30 should be closely aligned under our invariance assumptions. Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles} displays the life-cycle labor income profiles for our treatment and control groups and shows that the testable implication at age 30 holds for both males and females. Once the life-cycle labor income profiles are available, computing the present value gain in labor income due to treatment is straightforward.\footnote{The content in Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles} is sufficient but not necessary to calculate the gain of the program due to labor income. It would be sufficient to forecast the difference between the treatment and control groups. Forecasting the levels, however, provides us with additional testable implications. It also allow us to easily account for forecasting error and to verify that the life-cycle profiles that we estimate are comparable to observed profiles for similar socio-economic groups. The pattern of life-cycle labor income we generate is typical for that of low-skilled workers \citep{Blundell-etal_2015_J-Pub-E,Gladden_Taber_2000_WageProgression,Sanders-Taber_2012_AR,Lagakos_Moll_etal_2016_LifeCycle_NBER}.} We proceed similarly with the rest of outcomes---e.g.,\ parental labor income, crime, health.

Our forecasts impose an economic model where the observed difference between the treatment and control groups in long-term outcomes is generated by the experimentally-induced difference in the intermediate inputs. At age 22, for example, the treatment effect on labor income is generated by the treatment effects on the achievement test, years of schooling, and labor income at age 21. This extends on the methodology of \citet{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor}, whose objective is to  relate intermediate and long-term outcomes in a mediation analysis framework. They do no pursue the forecasting objective that we pursue. The forecasting functions that we rely on are estimated on a cohort of individuals who are older than our experimental sample. We require a ``no cohort effects'' assumption to hold, which is an (testable) implication of invariance across the experimental and non-experimental datasets. 

The construction of our forecasts and the present value gains requires a number of modeling and practical choices---e.g., functional form of the labor income function or discount rate for computing present value gains. We subject our analysis to a number robustness examinations of these choices. Our inference accounts for sampling uncertainty arising from data combination, estimation of the functions that we use to forecast, and forecasting error.

Figure~\ref{figure:main} previews our findings. It displays the discounted (using a 3\% discount rate) life-cycle benefits and costs of the program (2014 USD) pooled across genders, over all categories, and for separate categories as well.\footnote{The baseline discount rate of 3\% is an arbitrary decision. Using discount rates of 0\%, 3\%, and 7\%, the estimates for the benefit/cost ratios are 17.40 (s.e.\ 5.90), 7.33 (s.e.\ 1.84), and 2.91 (s.e.\ 0.59), respectively. We report estimates for discount rates between 0\% and 15\% in  Appendix~\ref{appendix:varying-discount-rate}.} These benefits are the inputs of our baseline estimates for the per-annum internal rates of return and the benefit/cost ratio. We conduct extensive sensitivity and robustness analyses to produce ranges of plausible values for the estimates of the internal rate of return (8.0,\ 18.3) and the benefit/cost ratio (1.52,\ 17.40). The costs of the program are substantial, as has frequently been noted by critics.\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{Fox_News_2014_Head_Start_Effects} and \citet{Whitehurst_2014_Senate_Testimony}.} But so are the benefits, which far outweigh the costs. The individual gains in labor income, parental labor income, crime, and health are at least as large in magnitude as the costs. As a consequence, our measures of social efficiency remain statistically and economically significant even after eliminating the benefits from any one of the four main components that we monetize. No single component drives our results.

Note: This figure displays the life-cycle net present values per program participant of the main components of the cost/benefit analysis of ABC/CARE from birth to forecasted death, discounted to birth at a rate of 3\%. By ``net" we mean that each component represents the total value for the treatment group minus the total value for the control group. Program costs: the total cost of ABC/CARE, including the welfare cost of taxes to finance it. Total benefits: the benefits for \textit{all} of the components we consider. Labor income: total individual labor income from age 21 to the retirement of program participants (assumed to be at age 67). Parental labor income: total parental labor income of the parents of the participants from when the participants were ages 1.5 to 21. Crime: the total cost of crime (judicial and victimization costs). To simplify the display, the following components are not shown in the figure: (i) cost of alternative preschool paid by the control-group children's parents; (ii) the social welfare costs of transfer income from the government; (iii) disability benefits and social security claims; (iv) costs of increased individual and maternal education (including special education and grade retention); (v) total medical public and private costs. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We indicate point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.
*QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years. Any gain corresponds to better health conditions until forecasted death, with $\$150,000$ (2014 USD) as the base value for a year of life.
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Our analysis is a template for estimating the life-cycle gains of social programs for which there is less than full lifetime follow-up. It is actually almost always the case that the analyst cannot wait for the participants of social programs to age so that full lifetime outcomes are available. Policy decision-makers cannot wait either and a rigorous answer to policy questions as the one that we tackle becomes urgent. In that context, supplementing experimental data with non-experimental data using economic and econometric theory becomes a powerful tool. This exercise reinforces the fact that randomization into treatment by itself is rarely the ``gold standard'' for evaluation of a full range of policy questions, an idea with recent advocacy in economics \citep{Athey_Imbens_2017_AE_JEP}. The urge to answer policy questions as the one we tackle has recently lead to informal and \textit{ad hoc} estimates of long-term benefits based on short-term measures of childhood scores \citep[e.g.][]{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}. We show how misleading this practice can be.

The paper unfolds in the following way. Section~\ref{section:background} describes the ABC/CARE program. Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} discusses our methodology to forecast life-cycle outcomes and the evidence supporting our assumptions. Section~\ref{section:cbapractice} discusses the practical aspects involved in applying our methodology. Section~\ref{section:cbaresults} reports our baseline estimates of internal rates of return and benefit/cost ratios. It also reports an array of sensitivity checks. Section~\ref{section:cbaresultscont} presents social efficiency measures for when the program is compared to alternative preschool programs that most of the control-group parents decided to use and for when it is compared to staying at home. We detail the assumptions required in order to identify and estimate these measures, which are more demanding than those required for comparing treatment and control (irrespective of take up of alternatives). Section~\ref{section:bcaestimates} examines the predictive validity of \emph{ad hoc} forecast methods currently used in the literature to estimate the long-term benefits of programs with short-term follow up. Section~\ref{section:conclusion} summarizes our findings and contextualizes them in the literature, providing interpretation caveats.

\section{ABC/CARE: Background} \label{section:background}

The Carolina Abecedarian Project and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (ABC/CARE). These programs offered child development form of childcare and targeted disadvantaged predominately African-American children in Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh in North Carolina.\footnote{Both ABC and CARE were designed and implemented by researchers at the Frank Porter Graham Center of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.} Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} describes these programs in detail. Here, we summarize their main features.

The goal of these programs is to enhance the life skills of disadvantaged children. Both programs support language, motor, and cognitive development as well as socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task orientation, the ability to communicate, independence, and pro-social behavior.\footnote{\citet{Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.} The programs provide health screenings to treatment group members, but health care costs were paid by parents.

ABC recruited four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1976. CARE recruited two cohorts of children, born between 1978 and 1980. For both programs, families of potential participants were referred to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother's last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was determined by a score on a childhood risk index.\footnote{See  Appendix~\ref{app:eligibility-pop} for details on the construction of the index. It weights the following variables (listed from the most to the least important according to the index): maternal and paternal education, family income, father's presence at home, lack of maternal relatives in the area, siblings behind appropriate grade in school, family on welfare, father in unstable job, low maternal IQ, low siblings' IQ, social agency indicates that the family is disadvantaged, one or more family members has sought a form of professional help in the last three years, and any other special circumstance detected by program's staff.}

In ABC, the initial sample consisted of 120 families. After various randomization compromises, the sample consisted of 111 subjects: 53 in the treatment group and 58 in the control group. In CARE, the initial sample consisted of 65 initial families, 23 were randomized to a control group, 25 to the family education treatment group (we do not consider this group in our combined ABC/CARE sample), and 17 to the family education and center-based childcare treatment group. Two families in the family education treatment group had twins who were jointly randomized, as in the case of ABC. Evaluation of this program is robust to small size inference \citep{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}. We  develop a methodology to thoroughly assess issues of randomization compromises and item non-response in Appendix~\ref{app:method_partialobs}. Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} provides all of the details of the randomization protocol and potential compromises.

The design and implementation of ABC and CARE were very similar. Both had two phases, the first of which lasts from birth until age 5. In this phase, children were randomly assigned to treatment. The second phase of the study consisted of child academic support through home visits from ages 5 through 8. The first phase of CARE, from birth until age 5, had an additional treatment arm of home visits designed to improve home environments.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} Our analysis uses the first phase and pools the ABC treatment group with the one of the CARE treatment groups. We do not use data from the CARE group that only received home visits in the early years. \cite{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} test and do not reject the hypothesis that the data sets used in this paper have a common structure.

For both programs, from birth until age 8, data were collected annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environments, family structure, and family economic characteristics. After age 8, data on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, education, and family economic characteristics were collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, measures of cognitive skills are unavailable for both ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have access to administrative criminal records and a physician-administered medical survey as well as a set of medical tests when the subjects were in their mid 30s.\footnote{See  Appendix~\ref{appendix:data} for a more comprehensive description of the data. There, we document the balance in observed baseline characteristics across the treatment and control groups after dropping the individuals for whom we have no crime or health information. There is substantial attrition for these data collections. Further, the methodology we propose addresses missing data in either of these two outcome categories.}

An important feature of the program is that the control-group children of both ABC and CARE attended alternative (to home and to treatment) childcare arrangements,\footnote{This is an example of the control group finding a treatment substitute in social experiments. See \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE} for methodological solutions and for a practical example.} 75\% and 74\% respectively. \citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev} first document this and provide some analysis on comparisons of treatment to control at alternative arrangements and treatment to home. The alternative arrangements are, in general, lower quality than ABC/CARE (see  Appendix~\ref{app:control-subbb}).

Those control-group children enrolled in alternative preschools early in their lives stayed enrolled. As control-group children aged, the were most like to become enrolled in these alternatives (see  Appendix~\ref{app:control-subbb}). Children enrolled in these alternatives were more likely to have mothers who worked at baseline.\footnote{The difference is statistically significant at 10\%.} Parents of control-group girls were much more likely than parents of control-group boys to use alternative childcare if assigned to the control group.\footnote{Most of the alternative childcare centers received federal subsidies and were subject to the federal regulations of the era ( Appendix~\ref{appendix:tetanus}). See \citet{Department-of-Health_1968_DayCareRequirements,NCGA_1971_House-Bill-100,Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}. They had relatively low quality compared to ABC/CARE.} Our main results compare treatment- and control-group children, irrespective of take-up of alternatives. In Section~\ref{section:cbaresultscont}, we refine our analysis to comparisons of treatment to alternatives and to staying at home.

\section{Forecasting Life-cycle Costs and Benefits: Method} \label{section:cbamethodology}

We begin by describing the treatment parameter that underlies our analysis. Let $W=1$ indicate that the parents referred to the program participate in the randomization protocol. $W=0$ indicates otherwise. $R$ indicates randomization into the treatment group ($R = 1$) or to the control group ($R = 0$). $D$ indicates attending the program, i.e., $D = R$ implies compliance with the initial randomization protocol.

Individuals are eligible to participate in the program if baseline background variables $\bm{B}\in\mathcal{B}_0$. $\mathcal{B}_0$ is the set of scores on the risk index that determines program eligibility. Because all of the eligible people given the option to participate choose to do so $(W=1\text{, and } D=R)$, we can safely interpret the treatment effects generated by the experiment as average treatment effects for the population for which $\bm{B}\in\mathcal{B}_0$ and not just treatment effects for the treated.\footnote{All providers of health care and social services (referral agencies) in the area of the ABC/CARE study were informed of the programs. They referred mothers whom they considered disadvantaged. Eligibility was corroborated before randomization. Our conversations with the program staff indicate that the encouragement from the referral agencies was such that most referred mothers attended and agreed to participate in the initial randomization \citep{Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.}

We now formalize the illustration that we provide in the introduction on our forecasting method. For the time being, the reader could think that the objective is to forecast labor income. We provide precise details on how we adapt our methodology when forecasting other outcomes in Section~\ref{section:cbapractice}.

Our methodology is based on a causal (structural) model for treatment ($d=1$) and control ($d=0$) counterfactual outcomes measured at age $a$ in sample $k \in \{e,n\}$, where $e$ denotes membership in the experimental sample and $n$ denotes membership in a non-experimental (auxiliary) sample:

\begin{equation}
Y^d_{k,a} = \phi^d_{k,a} (\bm{X}^d_{k,a}, \bm{B}_k) + \varepsilon^d_{k,a}, \label{eq:outcome}
\end{equation}

where $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ is a structural production relationship mapping inputs $\bm{X}^d_{k,a}, \bm{B}_k$ into output $Y^d_{k,a}$ holding error term $\varepsilon^d_{k,a}$ fixed.\footnote{Fixing and conditioning are fundamentally different concepts. See \cite{Haavelmo_1943_Econometrica} and \citet{Heckman_Pinto_2015_EconometTheory} for discussions.} $ \bm{B}_k$ are background variables not affected by treatment. $\bm{X}^d_{k,a}$ are variables potentially affected by treatment (intermediate inputs), including lagged dependent variables.

Equation~\eqref{eq:outcome} allows the relationship between $\bm{X}^d_{k,a}, \bm{B}_k$ and $Y^d_{k,a}$ to, in principle, differ between the experimental and the non-experimental samples. The model conceptualizes the two treatment regimes in the non-experimental sample, although experimental variation does not exist there by construction. The exercise then consists of providing conditions for identifying and estimating $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ in the non-experimental sample and use it as a means for forecasting in the experimental sample. The conditions provide implications that we can verify empirically. A summary of the steps is the following: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Construct a Synthetic Cohort.} Delimit the non-experimental sample so that it resembles the experimental sample in characteristics not affected by treatment. The reader could think of this step as constructing a super population resembling the population in the experiment in order to estimate structural parameters.
\item \textbf{Find Intermediate Inputs.} Construct a set of variables $\bm{X}^d_{k,a}$ that (i) are available in the experimental and the non-experimental data; (ii) the support in the non-experimental data contains the support in the experimental data; (iii) mediate or cause labor income; and (iv) are affected by treatment.
\item \textbf{Identify and Estimate $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ in the Non-experimental Sample.} Provide conditions in which $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ is identified in the non-experimental sample and form estimates of this function.
\item \textbf{Justify the use of  $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ as Means for Forecast.} Provide the structural invariance conditions that allow us to use $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ as a means for forecasting in the experimental sample. Test the corresponding implications of such conditions.
\item \textbf{Use $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ to Form Forecasts in the Experimental Sample.} Use the observed intermediate inputs in the experimental sample to evaluate $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ and initialize the forecast procedure. Form life-cycle forecasts iteratively. 
\item \textbf{Test the Performance of $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$  as a Means for Forecast.} Contrast forecasts with actual observations in the experimental data, when both are available.
\item \textbf{Provide Inference.} Provide standard errors that account for forecast model estimation error, forecasting error, and sampling uncertainty in the experimental and the non-experimental datasets. 
\end{enumerate}

We provide a summary of this procedure for the case of labor income next and place in Appendix~\ref{appendix:incomplete} a more technical discussion. Specifically, Appendix~\ref{appendix:just} formally states the theorem that allows us to recover out-of-sample counterfactual outcomes across the life cycle. Appendix~\ref{appendix:incomplete} also provides a lengthier discussion of several practical details.

\subsection{Construct a Synthetic Cohort} \label{section:synthetic}

We use the CNLSY to construct synthetic cohorts from ages 21 to 29. We use both the NLSY79 and PSID to forecast from ages 29 to 67. Whenever using the NLSY79 and PSID together, we combine them and use them as a joint sample. Put differently, we use the three data sets to obtain information across our time span of interest, without placing specific weights in any particular sample. This allows us to satisfy support conditions (see Appendix~\ref{app:containsupport}). An alternative to this is to to weight each of the observations in these samples according to the inverse of their variance in a set of observed characteristics.

In each sample, we place the following restrictions with the objective that non-experimental synthetic treatment or control groups are based on potential counterparts that would have been eligible for the program, i.e., $\bm{B}_{n} \in \mathcal{B}_0$. This is an approximation because details to construct the exact criteria in the non-experimental sample are not available.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{NLSY79:} Black, labor income less than \$300,000 (2014 USD) at any given year; subjects born between 1957 and 1965.
\item \textbf{PSID:} Black; birth year between 1945 and 1981.
\item \textbf{CNLSY:} Black, labor income less than \$300,000 (2014 USD) at any given year; subjects born between 1978 and 1983.
\end{enumerate}

Once we place these restrictions, we construct synthetic control and treatment groups by applying Algorithm~\ref{alg:match}. This algorithm provides a weight for each individual in the non-experimental according to her resemblance with the individuals in the experimental sample. When constructing synthetic control and treatment groups, we use each of the following variables for all the outcomes at all ages: year of birth, gender, number of siblings at baseline. The criterion for selecting these variables is availability across all non-experimental datasets. We construct one synthetic control group and one synthetic treatment group in each non-experimental sample (not one group for each age).

In the experimental sample, all of the parents of children with characteristics $\bm{B}_{e} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ agree to participate in the program. In the non-experimental sample, there was no randomized assignment to treatment. We can evaluate our construction of the synthetic control group by comparing the average labor income of individuals in the non-experimental sample for whom $\bm{B}_{n} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ to average the labor incomes of individuals in our synthetic control group. These two should coincide at each age. Further, they should coincide with observed labor income at age 30 in the experimental sample. Figure~\ref{figure:controltests} displays this test. The agreement is reassuringly close. Note that these comparisons do no involve yet estimation of  $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$.

We combine data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (CNLSY79). We highlight the observed labor income at $a^*$ (age 30) for the ABC/CARE control-group participants. We stop at age 45 for want of data to compute the childhood risk index defining $\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ in the auxiliary samples. Panel (b) displays the analogous figure for females. Standard errors are based on the empirical bootstrap distribution.
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsection{Find Intermediate Inputs} \label{section:inputs}

We list the requirements for the variables to be intermediate inputs above. For labor income, we use the average PIAT achievement score from ages 5 to 7, completed education, labor income at age 21, and lagged labor income (which is forecasted after age 22). Table~\ref{table:predlaborincome} shows that these variables predict labor income and Appendix~\ref{app:containsupport} documents common support across datasets. It is of greater interest for the main text of the paper to document the treatment effects generated by the program on these variables. This is crucial for our forecasts, as we will impose an economic model in which the forecasted treatment effect is mediated by the treatment effects on these variables. Table~\ref{table:summint} provides this summary.\footnote{We first present raw treatment-control mean differences. As we report in Table Table~\ref{table:summint}, the treatment effects are substantial across multiple outcomes. In some cases, this finding is at odds with what other studies report. The difference is explained, mainly, by the fact that we consider effects by gender. \citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE,Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ,Campbell_Pungello_etal_2001_DP,Campbell_Ramey_etal_2002_ADS,Campbell_Wasik_etal_2008_ECRQ,Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}. Only \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} divide the treatment effects by gender, however, to focus on the health effects, with men having many more positive effects especially in cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. This is consistent with the results we report below.}

\begin{table}[!htpb]
\begin{threeparttable}
\caption{Intermediate Inputs of Labor Income, Summary of Treatment Effects} \label{table:summint}
\centering
\input{output/income-inputs-description.tex}
\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item Note: This table shows the control-group difference and the raw mean difference between treatment and control (average treatment effects), by gender. Homoscedastic standard errors for the average treatment effects are in parentheses.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

Random assignment to treatment has statistically and economically significant effects on the intermediate inputs. For females, it increases the average PIAT score by almost a third of standard deviation (the test is standardized to an in-sample standard deviation of 15 units). For males, the effect is smaller. The program substantially boosts high-school graduation for females and college graduation for both males and females. As a joint summary of these effects, we use years of education as an intermediate input although the treatment effects are less precise. Labor income at age 21 is not greatly boosted by the program (partly due to labor supply). However, as the life-cycle evolves, lagged labor income is important for obtaining precise forecasts, as economic theory suggests. As the life cycle evolves, the program boosts labor income, especially for males for whom the average treatment effect is almost 20 thousand dollars.\footnote{Table~\ref{table:summint} displays age-21 and age-30 labor income because labor income is observed at ages 21 and 30 in the experimental sample. Labor income at age 30 is an input in our methodology only after age 30.}

\subsection{Identify and Estimate $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ in the Non-experimental Sample}

If we would only be interested in forecasting the treatment-control mean difference, we would not require to take a position on the exogeneity of $\bm{X}^d_k, \: k \in \{e,n\}$ with respect to labor income. Simpler conditions, spelled out as Conditions~\ref{cond:cond1} and~\ref{cond:cond2} in Appendix~\ref{appendix:incomplete}, would suffice. Exogeneity facilitates the use of economic theory to generate and interpret treatment effects, to test the validity of our synthetic control groups, and to find auxiliary sample counterparts to treatments and controls. It also facilitates a non-parametric approach that we discuss below. Exogeneity also makes identification of $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ in the non-experimental sample straightforward. Assumption~\ref{ass:exog} spells out this assumption, which we initially make and then explore alternatives.

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:exog} \textbf{Exogeneity}
Let $\{ 1, \ldots, A \}$ index the periods of a life cycle. For all $a, a'' \in \{ 1, \ldots, A \}$ and for $d, d' \in \{0,1\}$,
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon^d_{k,a} \indep \bm{X}^{d^{\prime}}_{k,a^{''}} | \bm{B}_k = \bm{b}
\end{equation}
for all $\bm{b}$ in the support of $\bm{B}_k, \: k \in \{e,n\}$, where ``$\bm{M} \indep \bm{N}|\bm{Q}$'' denotes independence of $\bm{M}$ and $\bm{N}$ given $\bm{Q}$. $\square$
\end{assumption}

To appreciate the benefit of Assumption~\ref{ass:exog}, consider the following example. Say we want to forecast labor income and we use years of education as a main component of $\bm{X}_{k,{a''}}^{d'}$. The joint distribution of $\varepsilon_{k,a}^d$ and $\bm{X}_{k,{a''}}^{d'}$ could differ substantially across experimental and non-experimental samples. In the experimental sample, years of education are boosted by treatment, which is randomly assigned. In the non-experimental samples, however, there is no treatment. Individuals with high observed levels of education could very well have a high value of  $\varepsilon_{k,a}^d$ (e.g., ability bias). Assumption~\ref{ass:exog} avoids this problem when making forecasts.

We can test and relax this assumption. We report tests for endogeneity in the experimental and auxiliary samples used in this paper. To do so, we assume that $\varepsilon_{k,a}^d, k \in \{e,n\}$ follows a factor structure.\footnote{Factor structure models are widely used in structural estimation of production functions of skills during early childhood. See, e.g., \citet{Cunha_Heckman_2008_JHR} and \citet{Cunha_Heckman_etal_2010_est_tech_cognoncog}.} Once we condition on $\bm{X}_{k,a}^d$ and $\bm{B}_{k}$, we do not reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity. Below, we also document that our results are robust to models that are more general than that in Equation~\eqref{eq:outcome} and, by construction, do not satisfy Assumption~\ref{ass:exog}.

\subsection{Justify the use of  $\phi^d_{k,a}\left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ as Means for Forecast} \label{section:justify} 

We assume that the variables $\bm{X}_{k,a}^d$ fully summarize treatment in the sense that any effect that treatment has on outcomes operates through the inputs, $\bm{X}_{k,a}^d$, and not through shifts in the production function relating inputs to outputs (see \citealp{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor}). Assumption~\ref{ass:summary} formalizes this condition.

\begin{assumption} \label{ass:summary} \textbf{Structural Invariance}
For all $\bm{x}, \bm{b} \in supp(\bm{X}^d_{k,a}, \bm{B}_k), k \in \{e,n\}$
\begin{align}
\phi_{k,a}^0 \left( \bm{x}, \bm{b} \right) &= \phi_{k,a}^1 (\bm{x}, \bm{b}) \\   \nonumber                                                                     &=: \phi_{a} (\bm{x}, \bm{b}),
\end{align}
$\phi_{a}(\bm{x}, \bm{b})$ is the function generating the causal effect of setting $ \bm{B}_k=\bm{b}, \bm{X}^d_{k,a}=\bm{x}$ holding $\varepsilon^d_{k,a}$ fixed for $a \in \{1,\dots,A\}$. $\square$
\end{assumption}

\begin{remark} \textbf{Two Distinct Aspects of Structural Invariance}
Assumption~\ref{ass:summary} has two distinct aspects which could be broken down into two separate assumptions: (i) the structural relationships evaluated at the same arguments have identical values for treatment and control groups in the experimental sample, and (ii) the analogous holds across the experimental and non-experimental samples.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark} \label{remark:cohort} \textbf{(No) Cohort Effects}
The second aspect of Assumption~\ref{ass:summary}, that the structural relationships are identical in the experimental and non-experimental samples, embeds a no cohorts effects assumption. That is: A structural function $\phi_{n,a}^d \left( \bm{x}, \bm{b} \right)$, which we identify and estimate in the non-experimental sample with subjects that are older than those in the experimental sample, is a valid means for forecast in the experimental sample. Note that this does not mean that there are not cohort effects in the outcome of interest, $Y_{k,a}^d$. Instead, it means that there are no cohort effects in the mapping between $\bm{X}_{k,a}, \bm{B}_k$ and $Y_{k,a}^d$. This provides testable implications, which we discuss next.
\end{remark}

Assumption~\ref{ass:summary} combined with Assumption~\ref{ass:exog}, and normalizing $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon^d_{k,a})=0$ for all $a \in \{1,\dots,A\}$, generates testable restrictions for our forecasting models. Exogeneity and invariance enable us to jointly test the two aspects of structural invariance for $a \leq a^*$, when $Y_{k,a}$ is observed in both the experimental and auxiliary samples:\footnote{The analogous implication if our only interest would be to forecast treatment effects is the following. Under our assumptions, experimental treatment effects should equal differences in the conditional means of the non-experimental samples evaluated at $\bm{X}_{n,a} = \bm{x}^1$ and  $\bm{X}_{n,a} = \bm{x}^0$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{e,a}^1 |  \bm{X}_{e,a}^1 = \bm{x}^1, \bm{B}_e = \bm{b}, D = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{e,a}^0 |  \bm{X}_{e,a}^0 = \bm{x}^0, \bm{B}_e = \bm{b}, D = 0 \right] = \nonumber \\
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{n,a} | \bm{X}_{n,a} = \bm{x}^1, \bm{B}_n = \bm{b} \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{n,a} | \bm{X}_{n,a} = \bm{x}^0, \bm{B}_n = \bm{b} \right].
\end{eqnarray}}

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{e,a}^1 | \bm{X}_{e,a}^1 = \bm{x}, \bm{B}_{e} = \bm{b}, D = 1   \right] &=&  \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{e,a}^0 | \bm{X}_{e,a}^0 = \bm{x}, \bm{B}_{e} = \bm{b}, D = 0   \right]  \\
\text{ and} & \nonumber \\
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{e,a}^d | \bm{X}_{e,a}^d = \bm{x}, \bm{B}_{e} = \bm{b}, D = d   \right] &=&  \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{n,a} | \bm{X}_{n,a} = \bm{x}, \bm{B}_{n} = \bm{b} \right] \text{ for }  d \in \{0,1\}.
\end{eqnarray}

We briefly summarize tests for these implications here and present a discussion at length in Appendix~\ref{app:invariance}. We first use the experimental sample and ask if, once we account for a set of the variables in $\bm{X}_{k,a}$, $R$ (randomization to treatment assignment in ABC/CARE, which, as discussed in text, is equivalent to $D$) predicts the outcome of interest, conditional on $\bm{B}_k$. This test verifies that $\bm{X}_{k,a}$ suffices to summarize the treatment generated by $R$. Under the null hypothesis, the coefficient associated with $R$ is zero and accumulates evidence in favor of invariance across treatment regimes. Similarly, at $a = a^*$ we can test invariance across samples at $a = a^*$ by verifying that an indicator of sample membership (experimental or auxiliary) is statistically equal to zero when pooling the two samples.

Table~\ref{table:invariance} summarize these tests. In Panel (a) we test invariance across treatment regimes using the experimental sample. We pool males and females to increase the power of our tests. We provide tests for both employment (as a complement) and labor labor income at age 30. The coefficient on $R$ is not significant when regressing either employment or labor income on mother's education (as a proxy for $\mathcal{B}_{0}$) and the intermediate inputs. For the case of employment, the test is precise. For the case of labor income, the test is less precise. After accounting for background variables and the intermediate inputs, average labor income is $284$ dollars (2014 USD) higher in the treatment group. This value is relatively low if considering that this is annual labor income at age 30 and the average in the control group is $26,084$. 

In Panel (b) we display tests of invariance in labor income at age 30 across experimental and non-experimental samples. The tests are not as precise as in Panel (a), but, as before, the coefficients associated with the relevant indicator are relatively low if compared with the average of the variable (average labor income in the experimental and non-experimental sample for males and females is $40,007$ and $24,584$ and  $32,717$ and $24,098$, respectively).

\subsection{Following Steps} \label{section:following}

Invariance across treatment regimes and samples makes $\phi_{a} (\cdot, \cdot)$ they basic ingredient for forecasting in the experimental sample, for which we discuss the intuition above. Appendix~\ref{appendix:gmm} formalizes our estimation and data combination procedure in a GMM framework.\footnote{As both a referee and various commentators of our paper usefully pointed out, our identification and estimation does not impose cross-sectional restrictions. That is, it does not identify and estimate the $\phi_{a} \left( \bm{x}, \bm{b} \right)$ for all of our outcomes. This is a consequence of a data restriction: We use different datasets to identify and estimate the  $\phi_{a} \left( \bm{x}, \bm{b} \right)$ for each outcome (i.e., labor income, health, crime). Thus, the predictor variables that we are able to use differ across outcomes and we cannot perform this estimation. This implies an efficiency loss because it impedes us from imposing cross-sectional restrictions across outcomes.} By doing so, it provides a step-by-step estimation recipe. As Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles} displays, forecasted and actual labor income are closely aligned, which is the final check for that we propose for our procedure. Computing the net present value, the internal rate of return, and benefit/cost ratios once the age-by-age forecasts are available is straightforward.\footnote{Some practical details involved in doing this are in Appendices~\ref{app:method_irr} and \ref{app:method_cbratio}.} Finally, we perform inference using bootstrap. Our inference accounts for each step of our estimation procedure. A step-by-step recipe for our inference is in Appendix~\ref{appendix:bootstrap}.

\subsection{Sensitivity} \label{section:sens}

The forecasted present value of the gain induced by treatment using the model in Equation~\eqref{eq:outcome} pooling males and females is $636,674$ (s.e.\ $183,224$) in 2014 USD. We provide estimates of the present value gain when using more general labor income models (in which Assumption~\ref{ass:exog} does not hold) in Table~\ref{table:predsens}. When pooling males and females and when separating the samples by gender, the present values remain within a range that does no affect the estimates of measure of overall efficiency that we provide in this paper.

A non-parametric alternative is to compress the whole procedure into the following. Under exogeneity assumption~\ref{ass:exog} and invariance condition~\ref{ass:summary} we can use matching to construct counterparts to the experimental treatment and control groups in the non-experimental sample.\footnote{\citet{Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1998_Econometrica} discuss this procedure.} Matching in this fashion creates direct counterparts in the auxiliary samples for each member of the experimental samples. It is an intuitively appealing non-parametric estimator that is valid under exogeneity \citep{Heckman_Navarro_2004_REStat}. We discuss this approach in Appendix~\ref{appendix:match}. Matching is a non-parametric estimation procedure for conditional mean functions. There is close agreement between non-parametric estimates based on matching and more parametric model-based approaches in Table~\ref{table:predsens}.

\section{Forecasting Life-cycle Costs and Benefits: Practice} \label{section:cbapractice}

In this section, we adapt the methodology in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} method to forecast the net benefit of the program due to treatment effects in parental income, crime, and health. The adaptation of our method has to do with practical rather than theoretical aspects involved in applying the methodology that we describe in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}. To illustrate this adaptation, we focus on health and provide brief details on crime and parental labor income. In Appendices~\ref{appendix:crime} and~\ref{app:parentalincome} we provide further documentation. The methodology for transfer income is identical to that in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}. Additional details for this are in Appendix~\ref{appendix:incomplete}. Straightforward calculations allow us to compute benefits and costs related to education and we describe those in Appendix~\ref{appendix:education}.

\subsection{Health}

We use health as an illustration because it is a major contribution of this paper to forecast and monetize the life-cycle benefits of enhanced participant health using a version of Equation~\eqref{eq:outcome} including a full vector of lagged dependent variables for different indicators of health status. This requires adapting the models of Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}, as well as estimating a dynamic model of competing health risks \citep{Kalbfleisch_Prentice_1980_failure}. Three additional issues arise: (i) health outcomes such as diabetes or heart disease are absorbing states; (ii) health outcomes are highly interdependent within and across time periods; and (iii) there is no obvious terminal time period for benefits and costs except death, which is endogenous.\footnote{For example, we extrapolate labor income until the retirement age of 67. For health, we need to forecast an age of death for each individual before extrapolating.}

Our auxiliary model for health is an adaptation of the Future America Model (FAM). This model forecasts health outcomes from the subjects' mid 30s up to their projected age of death \citep{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-Elderly-Model-Report}.\footnote{The simulation starts at the age in which we observe the subjects' age-30 follow-up.}  Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} discusses the FAM methodology in detail.

FAM passes a variety of specification tests and accurately forecasts health outcomes and healthy behaviors.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:health-validation}, we present tests of the model's assumptions and predictive performance for population aggregate health and healthy behavior outcomes.} We initialize the health forecast model using the same variables that we use to forecast labor and transfer income, along with the initial health conditions as listed in Table~\ref{table:transition}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{Mean Quality-Adjusted Life Years: Forecasts and Comparison to PSID}\label{fig:qalys}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{output/qalyexppsid.eps}
\footnotesize \justify
Note:  This figure displays the life-cycle net present value of forecasted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for ABC/CARE males and females in the control group. The forecasts are based on combining data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the Health Retirement Study (HRS), and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). For each gender, we display a comparison to disadvantaged males and females in the PSID, where disadvantaged is defined as being African American and having at most 12 years of education. QALYs are the quality-adjusted life years accounting for the burden of disease. The black dots indicate that the bars are significantly greater than 0 at the 10\% level. This is calculated using the empirical bootstrap distribution.
\end{figure}

Our methodology has five steps: (i) estimate age-by-age health state transition probabilities using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); (ii) match these transition probabilities to the ABC/CARE subjects based on observed characteristics; (iii) estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) models using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the PSID; (iv) estimate medical cost models using the MEPS and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), allowing estimates to differ by health state and observed characteristics; and (v) forecast the medical expenditures and QALYs that correspond to the simulated individual health trajectories.\footnote{As an intermediate step between (i) and (ii), we impute some of the variables used to initialize the FAM models (see  Appendix~\ref{section:FAM_ABC_impute}).}

Our microsimulation model starts with information on observed characteristics at age 30, along with the information on observed characteristics available at this age. Restricting it to the individuals for whom we have information from the mid 30s health survey allows us to account for components that are important for forecasting health outcomes. The models forecast the probability of being in any of the states in the horizontal axis of Table~\ref{table:transition} at age $a+1$ based on the state at age $a$, which is described by the vertical axis of the table.\footnote{In practice, the forecasts are based on two-year lags, due to data limitations in the auxiliary sources we use to simulate the FAM. For example, if the individual is 30 (31) years old in the age-30 interview, we simulate the trajectory of her health status at ages 30 (31), 32 (33), 34 (35), and so on until her projected death.} Absorbing states are an exception. For example, heart disease at age $a$ does not enter in the estimation of transitions for heart disease at age $a+1$ because it is an absorbing state: once a person has heart disease, she carries it through the rest of her life.

At each age, once we obtain the transition probability for each health outcome, we make a Monte-Carlo draw for each subject. Each simulation depends on each individual's health history and on her particular characteristics. For every simulated trajectory of health outcomes, we forecast the life-cycle medical expenditure using the models estimated from the MEPS and the MCBS. We then obtain an estimate of the expected life-cycle medical expenditure by taking the mean of each individual's simulated life-cycle medical expenditure.

The models estimated using MCBS represent medical costs in the years 2007--2010. The MEPS estimation captures costs during 2008--2010. To account for real medical cost growth after 2010, we adjust each model's forecast using the method described in  Appendix~\ref{appendix:health-fam-simulation}.

The same procedure is applied to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We compute a QALY model based on a widely-used health-related Quality-of-Life (HRQoL) measure (EQ-5D), available in MEPS.\footnote{For a definition and explanation of this instrument, see \citet{Dolan_1997_Modeling_MC,Shaw_etal_2005_EQ5D_MC}.} We then estimate this model using the PSID.

We estimate three models of medical spending: (i) Medicare spending (annual medical spending paid by parts A, B, and D of Medicare); (ii) private spending (medical spending paid by a private insurer or paid out-of-pocket by the individual); and (iii) all public spending other than Medicare. Each medical spending model includes the variables we use to forecast labor and transfer income, together with current health, risk factors, and functional status as explanatory variables.

We also calculate medical expenditure before age 30 (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:health-costs-before-age30}). The ABC/CARE interviews at ages 12, 15, 21 and 30 have information related to hospitalizations at different ages and number of births before age 30. We combine this information along with individual and family demographic variables to use MEPS to forecast medical spending for each age.

QALYs are crucial for our cost/benefit analysis because they monetize the health of an individual at each age. Figure~\ref{fig:qalys} plots our estimates of mean QALYs together with a PSID comparison for the control sample in an exercise analogous to that used to produce Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles}.\footnote{In our baseline estimation, we assume that each year of life is worth  $\$150,000$ (2014 USD). Our estimates are robust to substantial variation in this assumption, as we show in  Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity}.} Although there is not a clear age-by-age treatment effect on QALYs, there is a statistically and substantively significant difference in the accumulated present value of the QALYs between the treatment and the control groups. The QALYs for female individuals in the control group match the QALYs of disadvantaged individuals in the PSID. For males, use of the PSID auxiliary sample to construct controls understates the net benefits of ABC/CARE.\footnote{In  Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} we further discuss and justify the parameterizations required to obtain estimates of QALYs. We only consider QALYs starting at age 30. \citet{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-America-Model} examine the sensitivity to these parameterizations and discuss alternative micro-simulations monetizing health condition.}

\subsection{Crime}

To estimate the life-cycle benefits and costs of ABC/CARE related to criminal activity, we use rich data on crime outcomes obtained from public records. Two previous studies consider the impacts of ABC on crime: \citet{Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ} use administrative crime records up to age 21, and find no statistically significant differences between the treatment and the control groups. \cite{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} account for self-reported crime at age 21. They find weak effects based on self-reports, but they lack access to longer term, administrative data. The novelty of our study with respect to crime does not only consist of using administrative data allowing us to know the accumulated number of crimes that the children commit once they were in their mid 30s. It is also novel because we use micro-data specific to the state in which these individuals grew up, as well as other national datasets, to forecast criminal activity from the mid 30s to 50. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:crime} for a a complete discussion of our crime forecasts.

\subsection{Parental Labor Income} \label{section:pincome}

ABC/CARE offers childcare to the parents of treated children for more than nine hours a day for five years, 50 weeks a year. Only $27\%$ of mothers of children reported living with a partner at baseline and this status barely changed during the course of the experiment (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}). The childcare component generates substantial treatment effects on maternal labor force participation and parental labor income as reported in \cite{Garcia_Heckman_Ziff_2017_Gender-Diff_UNPUBLISHED}. This arises from wage growth due to parental educational attainment and more work experience.\footnote{There is also an effect on maternal school enrollment. Some of the mothers decided to further enroll in school, obtained a higher degree, and that could be one of the reasons why they make more money afterward. We report these treatment effects in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}. We quantify the cost of this additional education using the strategy in Appendix~\ref{appendix:education}.}

We observe parental labor income at eight different ages for the experimental subjects up through age 21.\footnote{The ages at which parental labor income is observed are 0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 15, and 21. At age 21 the mothers of the ABC/CARE subjects were, on average, 41 years old.}$^,$\footnote{We linearly interpolate parental labor income for ages for which we do not have observations between 0 and 21.} An ideal approach would be to estimate the profile over the full life-cycle of mothers. We propose two different approaches for doing this in Appendix~\ref{app:parentalincome}: (i) an approach based on parameterizing parental labor income using standard Mincer equations; and (ii) an approach based on the analysis of Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}. In Section~\ref{section:cbaresults}, we present estimates using the labor income through age 21 and using these two alternatives for projecting future labor income after age 21. The benefits of the program increase when considering the full life-cycles of mothers using either approach.

Any childcare inducements of the program likely benefit parents who, at baseline, did not have any other children. If they did, then they might have had to take care of other children anyway, weakening the childcare-driven effect, especially if there are younger siblings present. In Appendix~\ref{app:parentalincome}, we show that the treatment effect for discounted parental labor income is much higher when there are no siblings of the participant children at baseline. The effect also weakens when comparing children who have siblings younger than 5 years old to children who have siblings 5 years old or older.\footnote{These patterns persist when splitting the ABC/CARE sample by gender, but the estimates are not precise because the samples become too small. See Appendix~\ref{app:parentalincome}.}

\subsection{Program Costs} \label{section:programscosts}

The yearly cost of the program was \$18,514 per participant in 2014 USD. We improve on previous cost estimates using primary-source documents.\footnote{Our calculations are based on progress reports written by the principal investigators and related documentation recovered in the archives of the research center where the program was implemented. We display these sources in Appendix~\ref{app:programcosts}. The main component is staff costs. Other costs arise from nutrition and services that the subjects receive when they were sick, diapers during the first 15 months of their lives, and transportation to the center. The control-group children also receive diapers during approximately 15 months, and iron-fortified formula. The costs are based on sources describing ABC treatment for $52$ children. We use the same costs estimates for CARE, for which there is less information available. The costs exclude any expenses related to research or policy analysis. A separate calculation by the implementers of the program indicates almost an identical amount (see  Appendix~\ref{app:programcosts}).} Appendix~\ref{app:programcosts} discusses the program costs in detail. This section reports benefit/cost and rate of return analyses underlying Figure~\ref{figure:main}.  Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity} displays an extensive sensitivity analysis of each of the components we consider. It includes scenarios in which all of our assumptions hold and scenarios in which they are violated, providing bounds for our estimates.

\section{Main Results and Sensitivity Analysis} \label{section:cbaresults}

We first present our main estimates and then conduct sensitivity analyses.\footnote{See Appendices~\ref{app:method_irr} and~\ref{app:method_cbratio} for more details on these estimations. We note that one limitation of our analysis is that data limitations prevent us from jointly estimating all of the behavioral relationships considered in this paper. Different components of the net benefits are estimated on different data sets.} Table~\ref{table:bcsens} gives our baseline estimates of benefit/cost ratios and the sensitivity of the estimates to alternative assumptions. Table~\ref{table:irrsens} presents the corresponding internal rates of return. Pooling males and females, the results indicate that the program is socially efficient: the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are $13.7\%$ and $7.3$. \textit{Our baseline estimates indicate that the program generates a benefit of $7.3$ dollars for every dollar spent on it}. These estimates are statistically significant, even after accounting for sampling variation, serial correlation, and forecast error in the experimental and auxiliary samples and the tax costs of financing the program.\footnote{We obtain the reported standard errors by bootstrapping \emph{all} steps of our empirical procedure, including variable selection, imputation, model selection steps, and forecast error (see  Appendix~\ref{appendix:bootstrap}).} These benefits arise despite the fact that ABC/CARE was much more expensive than other early childhood education programs because the program used more services over a longer time period.

We accompany these estimates with an extensive set of sensitivity checks of statistical and economic interest. Our estimates are not driven by our methods for accounting for attrition and item non-response, by the conditioning variables, or the functional forms of projection equations used when computing the net-present values.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology} for a detailed discussion.} Although the internal rate of return remains relatively high when using participant outcome measures only up to ages 21 or 30, the benefit/cost ratios indicate that accounting for benefits that go beyond age 30 is important. The return to each dollar is at most $3/1$ when only considering benefits up to age 30 only (forecast span columns). Accounting for the treatment substitutes available to controls also matters. Males benefit the most from ABC/CARE relative to attending alternative childcare, while females benefit the most from ABC/CARE relative to staying at home. We explore this difference below.

Counterfactuals: we consider treatment vs. next best (baseline), treatment vs. stay at home, and treatment vs. alternative preschools (see Section~\ref{section:cbaresultscont} for a discussion).

\end{threeparttable}
\end{sidewaystable}

Our baseline estimates account for the deadweight loss caused by distortionary taxes to fund programs, plus the direct costs associated with collecting taxes.\footnote{When the transaction between the government and an individual is a direct transfer, we consider 0.5 as the cost per each transacted dollar. We do not weight the final recipient of the transaction (e.g., transfer income). When the transaction is indirect, we classify it as government spending as a whole and consider its cost as 1.5 per each dollar spent (e.g., public education).} We assume a marginal tax rate of $50\%$.\footnote{\citet{Feldstein_1999_REStat} reports that the deadweight loss caused by increasing existing tax rates (marginal deadweight loss) may exceed two dollars per each dollar of revenue generated. We use a more conservative value (0.5 dollars per each dollar of revenue generated). In Tables~\ref{table:bcsens}, \ref{table:irrsens}, and in  Appendix~\ref{appendix:varying-dwl}, we explore the robustness of this decision and find little sensitivity.} Our estimates are robust to dropping it to $0\%$ or doubling it to $100\%$ (deadweight loss columns). Our baseline estimate of benefit/cost ratios is based on a discount rate of $3\%$. Not discounting roughly doubles our benefit/cost ratios, while they remain statistically significant using a higher discount rate of $7\%$ (discount rate columns).

Parental labor income effects induced by the childcare subsidy is an important component of the benefit/cost ratio. We take a conservative approach in our baseline estimates and do not account for potential shifts in profiles in parental labor income due to education and work experience subsidized by childcare (see the discussion in Section~\ref{section:pincome}). Our baseline estimates rely solely on parental labor income when participant children are ages 0 to 21. Alternative approaches considering the gain for the parents through age 67 generate an increase in the gain due to parental labor income (see parental labor income columns).

As noted in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}, the baseline estimates ignore cohort effects. Individuals in ABC/CARE could experience positive cohort effects that might (i) make them more productive and therefore experience wage growth \citep{Lagakos_Moll_etal_2016_LifeCycle_NBER}; (ii) experience a negative shock such as an economic crisis and therefore experience a wage decline \citep{Jarosch_2016_JobSecurity_Econometrica}. Our estimates are robust when we vary annual growth and decay rates between $-0.5\%$ and $0.5\%$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{Benefit/Cost Ratio and Internal Rate of Return when Accounting for Different Combinations of the Main Benefits}\label{figure:vennpooled}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.7\columnwidth]{output/venn_pooled.pdf}
\footnotesize \justify
Note: This figure presents all possible combinations of accounting for the benefits from the four major categories in our analysis. The non-overlapping areas present estimates accounting for a single category as the benefit. Where multiple categories overlap, we account for benefits from each of the overlapping categories. The other components remain constant across all calculations and are the same as in Figure~\ref{figure:main}. Health combines QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) and health expenditure. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We put boxes around point estimates that are statistically significant at the $10\%$ level.
\end{figure}

We also examine the sensitivity of our estimates to (i) dropping the most costly crimes such as murders and rapes;\footnote{Two individuals in the treatment group were convicted of rape and one individual in the control group was convicted of murder.} and (ii) halving the costs of victimization and judiciary costs related to crime. The first sensitivity check is important because we do not want our estimates to be based on a few exceptional crimes. The second is important because victimization costs are somewhat subjective (see  Appendix~\ref{appendix:crime-VI}). Our cost/benefit estimates are robust to these adjustments, even though crime is a major component of it. We also examine the sensitivity with respect to our main health component: quality-adjusted life years. This is an important component because healthier individuals survive longer, and treatment improves health conditions. It is important to note that this component largely accumulates later in life and therefore is heavily discounted. Dropping the component or doubling the value of life does not have a major impact on our calculations.

Figure~\ref{figure:vennpooled} summarizes the results from our extensive sensitivity analyses. It shows the estimated rates of return and benefit/cost ratios when we calculate our estimates under the assumption that only one of the many streams we consider is the source of the benefit. We calculate the estimates with all possible combinations of the main benefit and cost streams. Our measures of economic efficiency remain statistically and economically significant even after eliminating the benefits from any one of the four main components that we monetize. No single component drives our results. We report estimates from a variety of specifications of regressors and functional forms. Our estimates are robust to different plausible assumptions about the values of non-market outcomes, for which conventional estimates of standard errors are not available. Overall, our sensitivity analyses indicate that no single category of outcomes drives the social efficiency of the program. Rather, it is the life-cycle benefits across multiple dimensions of human development.

\section{Alternative and No Preschool} \label{section:cbaresultscont}

Our analysis so far compares the treatment to the control group, irrespective of the setting in which the control-group children developed. By construction, this exercise compares treatment to the ``next best'' alternative that the parents of the control-group children elected. As we document in Section~\ref{section:background}, almost 75\% of the control-group children were enrolled in an alternative.

We refine our analysis to draw two further comparisons: (i) ABC/CARE compared to no treatment at all (so that the control child stayed at home); and (ii) ABC/CARE compared alternative preschool arrangements, which we describe in Section~\ref{section:background}. 

To briefly fix ideas on these comparisons and the additional requirements for identification, let $\bm{Y}^1_a$ be the outcome vector at age $a$ for the treated. $\bm{Y}^0_a$ is the age-$a$ outcome vector for the controls. All treatment-group children have the same exposure. We simplify the analysis of the controls by creating two categories. ``$H$'' indicates that the control-group child is in home care throughout the entire length of the program. ``$C$'' indicates that a control-group child is in alternative center childcare for any amount of time.\footnote{In our companion paper, \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Ziff_2017_Gender-Diff_UNPUBLISHED}, we show that this is a sensible assumption and document that the choice of different categorizations of take up of alternatives.} We thus compress a complex reality into two counterfactual outcome states at age $a$ for control-group subjects:
\begin{align*}
\bm{Y}_{a,H}^0 \quad &: \quad \textbf{ Subject received home care exclusively} \\
\bm{Y}_{a,C}^0 \quad &: \quad \textbf{ Subject received some alternative childcare}.
\end{align*}

We define $V$ as a dummy variable indicating participation by control-group children in an alternative childcare. $V=0$ denotes staying at home. The outcome when a child is in control status is
\begin{equation}
\bm{Y}^0_a : = \left( 1 - V \right) \bm{Y}^0_{a,H} + \left( V \right) \bm{Y}^0_{a,C}. \label{eq:meandiff}
\end{equation}

It is fruitful to assess the effectiveness of the program with respect to a counterfactual world in which the child stays at home full time. The associated causal parameter for those who would choose to keep the child at home is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:influenza}
\bm{\Delta}_a \left(V = 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ \bm{Y}^1_a - \bm{Y}^0_a | V = 0, W = 1 \right] := \mathbb{E} \left[\bm{Y}^1_{a} - \bm{Y}^0_{a,H} | V = 0, \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right].
\end{equation}

It is also useful to assess the average effectiveness of a program relative to attendance in an alternative childcare center for those who would choose an alternative:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:smallpox}
\bm{\Delta}_a \left( V =1 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ \bm{Y}^1_a - \bm{Y}^0_a | V = 1, W = 1 \right] := \mathbb{E} \left[\bm{Y}^1_a - \bm{Y}^0_{a,C} | V = 1, \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right].
\end{equation}

Random assignment to treatment does not directly identify \eqref{eq:influenza} or \eqref{eq:smallpox}. Econometric methods are required to identify these parameters. The estimates that we provide in this paper rely on matching (conditions on observables) to control for selection into the home or take-up of alternatives. In \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Ziff_2017_Gender-Diff_UNPUBLISHED}, we document that alternative strategies provide similar results. We combine the matching strategies with the methodology in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} to produce forecasts and provide measures of social efficiency refining the counterfactual comparison for the control-group children.

Figure~\ref{fig:npvsgender} summarizes the results from this exercise. There are substantial differences between males and females in one counterfactual: treatment vs. alternative preschools. The estimated treatment effects are very similar across genders for treatment compared to those staying at home full time. Males benefit much more from treatment relative to alternative preschools compared to their benefits from treatment relative to staying at home. This result is consistent with findings noted elsewhere: (i) stark gender differences resulting from attending low-quality childcare \citep{Kottelenberg_Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects,Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects}; and (ii) females are less sensitive to uncertain environments \citep{Autor-etal_2015_Family-Disadvantage}.

Our evidence does not indicate that the program has no benefits for females. When compared to staying at home, there is a gain of 4.93 dollars per each dollar invested. When we decompose the net-present value for each of the components that we monetize, we find substantial benefits for females across a variety of categories, including health and crime. For males, the magnitudes are noticeably increased when comparing outcomes from treatment to outcomes from attending alternative preschools.

Note: This figure displays the life-cycle net present values of the main components of the cost/benefit analysis of ABC/CARE from birth to forecasted death, discounted to birth at a rate of 3\%. ``Treatment vs. Control'': compares the treatment to the control group. ``Treatment vs. Stay at Home'': compares the treatment group to those subjects who stayed at home. ``Treatment vs. Alternative Preschool'': compares the treatment group to those subjects who attended alternative preschools. The latter two are based on matching estimators that account for selection on observable variables. By ``net" we mean that each component represents the total value for the treatment group minus the total value for the control group. Program costs: the total cost of ABC/CARE, including the welfare cost of taxes to finance it. Total net benefits: are for \textit{all} of the components we consider. Labor income: total individual labor income from ages 20 to the retirement of program participants (assumed to be age 67). Parental labor income: total parental labor income of the parents of the participants from when the participants were ages 1.5 to 21. Crime: the total cost of crime (judicial and victimization costs). To simplify the display, the following components are not shown in the figure: (i) cost of alternative preschool paid by the parents of control group children; (ii) the social welfare costs of transfer income from the government; (iii) disability benefits and social security claims; (iv) costs of increased individual and maternal education (including special education and grade retention); (v) total medical public and private costs. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We indicate point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.\\
*The treatment vs. stay at home net present value is sizable and negative (-\$123,498,.2); its standard error is \$62,745.72.\\
**QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years. Any gain corresponds to better health conditions until forecasted death, with $\$150,000$ (2014 USD) as the base value for a year of life.

\section{Understanding Recent Benefit-Cost Analyses} \label{section:bcaestimates}

We use our analysis to examine the empirical foundations of the approach to benefit/cost analysis taken in a prototypical study of \citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}, which in turn is based on estimates taken from \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}. Although widely emulated, this approach offers an imprecise approximation of benefit/cost ratios with questionable validity. Examples of application of this approach include \citet{Attanasio_Kugler_Meghir_2011_AEJAE}, \cite{Behrman-et-al_2011_JHR-Progresa}, and \cite{Deshpande_Yue_2017_Screened_Unpublished}.

\citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE} use data from the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) and report a benefit/cost ratio between $1.50$ and $1.84$.\footnote{HSIS is a one-year-long randomized evaluation of Head Start.} Their analysis proceeds in three steps: (i) calculate program treatment effects on IQ measured around age 5;\footnote{They use an index based on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary and Woodcock Johnson III Tests.} (ii) monetize this gain using the return to the IQ measured between ages 5 and 7 in terms of net present value of labor income at age 27 using the estimates of \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE};\footnote{The \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} return is based on Stanford Achievement Tests.}$^,$\footnote{For this comparison exercise, we interpret the earnings estimated in \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} to be equivalent to labor income.}$^,$\footnote{Calculations from \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} indicate that a 1 standard deviation gain in IQ at age 5 implies a $13.1\%$ increase in the net present value of labor income through age 27. This is based on combining information from Project Star and administrative data at age 27.} and (iii) calculate the benefit/cost ratio based on this gain and their own calculations of the program's cost.\footnote{Their calculation assigns the net present value of labor income through age 27 of $\$385,907.17$ to the control-group participants, as estimated by  \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}.}$^,$\footnote{All monetary values that we provide in this section are in 2014 USD. We discount the value provided by \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} to the age of birth of the children in our sample (first cohort).}

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

To analyze how our estimates compare to those based on this method, we present a series of exercises in the fourth column of Table~\ref{table:comparing}. For purposes of comparison, the fifth column of Table~\ref{table:comparing} shows the analogous estimates based on our own samples and forecasts.

In the first exercise, we calculate the benefit/cost ratio using both the ``return to IQ'' and the net present value of labor income at age 27 reported in \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}. This calculation is the same type of calculation as that used in \citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}. In the second exercise, we perform a similar exercise but use our own estimate of the net present value of labor income at age 27.\footnote{This allows us to compute our own ``return to IQ'' and impute it to the treatment-group individuals.} In this exercise, the standard errors account for variation in the return because we calculate the return in every bootstrapped re-sample. In that sense, our approach is a valid account of underlying uncertainties when compared to \citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}, who do not account for estimation error in reporting standard errors. The return is smaller because our sample is much more disadvantaged than that of \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}.

The remaining exercises are similar, but we (i) increase the age range over which we calculate the net-present value of labor income; or (ii) consider the value of all the components we analyze throughout the paper, in addition to labor income. The more inclusive the benefits measured and the longer the horizon over which they are measured, the greater the benefit/cost ratio. The final reported estimate, 7.33, is our baseline estimate that incorporates all of the components across the life cycle of the subjects.

Our methodology provides a more accurate estimate of the net present value (and the return to IQ) of the program. We better quantify the effects of the experiment by considering benefits over the whole life cycle. We also better approximate the statistical uncertainty of our estimates by considering both the sampling error in the experimental and auxiliary samples and the forecast error due to the interpolation and extrapolation. Proceeding in this fashion enables us to examine the sensitivity of each of the components in our study.

\section{Summary and Contextualization of Results} \label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we go beyond the analysis of batteries of short-term outcomes on test scores or analysis of isolated domains of human capital to evaluate the effectiveness of high-quality early childhood education. We exploit data generated by high-quality early childhood education program with longitudinal follow up. The available data follow-ups go from birth to when the program participants were in their mid 30s. Using economic models, we supplement the experimental data with non-experimental datasets to estimate life-cycle benefits and costs to evaluate the program's social efficiency.

Our analysis accounts for multiple sources of statistical and modeling uncertainty. We go beyond current analyses that only quantify a single, short-term treatment effects to forecast labor income without providing a sense of statistical and modeling uncertainty. We quantify long-term costs and benefits and provide a life-cycle analysis. We quantify and monetize health outcomes, a novel feature in the evaluation of early childhood programs.

We estimate that the internal rate of return (benefit/cost ratio) of the program ranges from 8.0\% to 18.3\% (1.52 to 17.40). These results indicate that investing in this program is highly socially profitable. ABC/CARE does not represent what is currently offered as early childhood education, although it has been widely replicated around the world. ABC/CARE is a prototype of what early childhood education should be. 

A fundamental question for policy implementation is: Would these returns hold if the program is replicated elsewhere? On one hand, it is true that ABC/CARE was implemented in a specific and economically advantaged setting. On the other hand, the value of this paper is to provide the life-cycle benefits of this program, which the essential elements of this program could generate. Of course, its long term effectiveness, and this social efficiency, needs to be complemented with the provision of schooling and job opportunities because economic opportunity complements the skills that this program fosters.
