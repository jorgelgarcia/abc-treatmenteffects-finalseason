Note: this table displays the average treatment effects estimated using various methods to
account for control contamination. The number number of observations is refers to the 
original sample, and may differ across the estimation methods presented in Columns (1)--(6). 
The control mean is the projected mean when estimating the treatment 
effects using the method of Column (1). Column (1) displays the estimates using the original
sample, without accounting for control contamination. 
Column(2) displays the estimates when we drop control subjects with 1 month or more of preschool.
Column (3) does the same for subjects with 24 months or more. Column (4) displays the LATE
estimate when we consider control subjects with 1 month or more of preschool to have received
equal treatment to ABC subjects. Column (5) does the same for subjects with 24 months or more.
Column (6) displays the LATE estimates when we assume that alternative forms of childcare
are of equal quality to ABC, but account for the number of months control subjects were
enrolled in childcare. All estimates are the mean of the empirical bootstrap generated 
from 200 resamples of the original data. Numbers in parentheses represent the naive $p$-value,
numbers in brackets represent the $p$-value from multiple testing, both of which are obtained from 
the standard deviations of the empirical bootstrap distribution.
