This section reports estimates of treatment effects by gender for the main outcomes, tests of equality of effects by gender by outcome, and combining functions. These estimates show that the program treatment effects are strong for both males and females. Treatment effects depend on the counterfactual against which they are benchmarked (home or low-quality center childcare). Treatment effects differ sharply by gender.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{appendix:bootstrap} for the exact procedure we use to conduct inference.}

\subsection{Estimated Treatment Effects}

Tables~\ref{table:tescombinedmales} and \ref{table:tescombinedfemales} present estimates of a representative selection of treatment effects for males and females respectively. The full list of treatment effects is reported in Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}. Column (1) of each table gives sample mean differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups. Column (2) adjusts the differences for attrition and controls for background variables. Both are estimates of the parameter defined in equation~\eqref{eq:effect}, but with different conditioning sets. Column (3) shows the mean difference between the full treatment-group and the control-group subjects who stay at home. Column (4) gives matching estimates for the parameter defined in equation~\eqref{eq:influenza}.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{app:matching-is-fun}, we provide details on: (i) the kernel matching estimator that we use; (ii) the matching variables that we use; and (iii) a sensitivity analysis to these matching variables.} Column (5) reports estimates of the parameter defined by equation~\eqref{eq:smallpox}: mean differences between the treatment-group and control-group children who attended alternatives. Column (6) gives matching estimates for the parameter of equation~\eqref{eq:smallpox}.\footnote{We want to clarify one set of variables: those related to parental income. There are some considerations that contribute to the higher parental income at the later ages. One consideration is that the variables are asked differently, with the question at age 3.5 using categories. These categories end at greater than \$14,000, which truncates the distribution. Although we fill this out using a tobit model, we cannot fully impute these higher incomes. The other consideration is that the mothers are very young, with many being enrolled in school at the child's birth. Once the children are 8, more mothers have entered the workforce which in turn increases the reported income.}

The results for females show that ABC/CARE has substantial effects on education when comparing outcomes of the treatment-group subjects to those from the next best alternative. High school graduation increases between 13 and 25 percentage points, depending on which estimate we consider; college graduation increases 13 percentage points; and the average years of schooling increase between 1.8 and 2.1 years. Employment at age 30 increases between 8 and 13 percentage points. ABC/CARE has substantial impacts on human capital accumulation and employment. The results strengthen when we compare treatment outcomes with outcomes for those who remain at home.

The results for males are different from those for females. Treatment has substantial effects when compared to the next best alternative. The effects are positive for a variety of health indicators, including drug use and hypertension. The effects on employment and labor income are sizable. The increase in employment at age 30 ranges from 11 to 19 percentage points. Labor income at age 30 increases between \$19,000 and \$24,000 (2014) after treatment. The effects strengthen when comparing treatment to low-quality childcare. Separation from the mother and being placed in relatively low-quality childcare centers has more deleterious consequences for males than for females.\footnote{This is consistent with the evidence in \citet{Kottelenberg_Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects} and \citet{Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects} and the analysis of \citet{Golding_Fitzgerald_2017_IMHJ}.}

The results hold when using other definitions of control substitution, which vary by exposure length. They remain statistically significant or are borderline statistically insignificant when computing two-tailed $p$-values (see Appendix~\ref{app:vsensitivity-twosided}). When using step-down $p$-values (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} for the full set of step-down $p$-values), the health results remain statistically significant for males, when compared to the full control group and when compared to alternative center childcare. The education results remain statistically significant for females, when compared to the full control group and when compared to those who stay at home.

The estimated effects for females and males in Columns (3) and (5) in their respective tables are not based on adjustments for baseline covariates (matching); the estimates in (4) and (6) are. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:bvariables}, we justify our choice of matching variables. We conduct a thorough analysis to conclude that there is little sensitivity to the choice of these variables.\footnote{We also present this sensitivity analysis changing the variables used to condition while estimating treatment effects and changing the variables used to construct the weights to account for attrition.}

We also test whether estimated treatment effects are equal across genders. Table~\ref{table:genderdifference-tes} reports differences between males and females in the control and treatment groups across major categories of outcomes. Within each category there are multiple measures. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we reject equality of the distributions of the treatment and control groups.\footnote{We explain the procedure in its entirety in Appendix~\ref{little-gdiff-tes}. In summary, we bootstrap with replacement 1,000 times. For bootstrap $b \in [1, \ldots, 1,000]$ we compute the treatment effect for males, $T_{M,b}$, and females, $T_{F,b}$. These treatment effects represent a pair $(T_{M,b}, T_{F,b})$. Over the distribution of these pairs, we compute the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which compares the empirical distribution of the treatment effects for males to the empirical distribution of the treatment effects for females. We repeat this procedure for each outcome.} The general pattern is that male results are stronger than female results in the control group. The pattern is generally reversed in the treatment group. The results are robust to adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing. Similar results emerge when we use a more complete set of outcomes (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-tes}).

The $p$-values corresponding to each difference is from a Wilcoxon signed-rank test that compares the empirical distributions over 100 bootstrapped resamples. An asterisk indicates that the $p$-value remains significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. The blocks are over outcome categories reported in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-tes}. We report the analogous estimates for the 126 outcomes in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-tes}.

\subsection{Estimated Combining Functions}

We consider a total of 126 outcomes reported in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-tes}. Measures of cognitive, social-emotional, and parenting skills were collected during the intervention or while the subjects were in school. The researchers collected information on the subjects' academic performance including grade retention and special education. The adult surveys (at ages 21 and 30) cover items related to employment, post-secondary education, health, criminal activity, and family structure. When the subjects were in their mid 30s, the researchers collected administrative crime data and data from a full medical survey.

Given the large number of outcomes measured in the numerous follow-ups, reporting all treatment effects would overwhelm the reader. A companion paper, \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}, aggregates treatment effects by monetizing benefits and constructing lifetime profiles of outcomes to conduct cost/benefit and rate of return analyses. The benefits from ABC/CARE are largely driven by its effects on males. The mean benefit/cost ratio is 10.19 for males and 2.61 for females with a range of estimates all bounded above 1.

In this section, we report treatment effects by category and the proportion of statistically significant effects. We use combining functions, which count the number of positive (and significant) treatment effects by gender. We adjust for dependence across outcomes and for pretesting in constructing standard errors (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}). The combining functions indicate that females benefit more from the program than do males, in the sense that there are more outcomes across multiple domains for which female treatments benefit relative to female controls. However, as shown in \cite{Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}, the monetary benefits of the program are greater for boys in part because it reduces costly criminal activity.

We find strong evidence of gender differences in education and employment. For females in comparison to alternative childcare, 40\% of the education outcomes and 20\% of the employment outcomes are positive and significant. These increase to 80\% and 100\% when compared to staying at home. The treatment advantage for males is only seen when compared to those males who attended alternative childcare centers. None of the education or employment outcomes are statistically significant and positive when compared to staying at home.

We test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal to 50\%. Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} shows that the proportions for both genders are statistically significantly greater than 50\%. The proportion is higher for females. When considering the proportion of outcomes that are both positive and statistically significant at the 10\% level, we test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal to 10\%.\footnote{Our inference accounts for the dependence across outcomes, as we explain in Section~\ref{sec:combining-functions} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}. Using an $\alpha$-level of significance, one would expect to find by chance that $\alpha\%$ of the treatment effects are ``statistically significant,'' even if the null hypothesis of no effect of the program is true.} A similar pattern holds for this test as well, although the proportions are smaller. Across outcomes, the effects are stronger for males when comparing treatment to alternative childcare, but are stronger for females when comparing treatment to staying at home. This pattern holds in the individual treatment effects, the combining functions, and the cost/benefit analysis of \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.

We next report estimates of the proportion of beneficial effects by outcome category and overall. This analysis is based on treatment effect \eqref{eq:effect}. Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} displays the results from this analysis: ABC/CARE positively impacted a large percentage of the outcomes. We show the counts for treatment compared to the next best alternative chosen by parents in Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivenb}. Proportionately more outcomes are beneficial for females, but the proportions are high for both groups and well above the benchmark of $\frac{1}{2}$. In Tables~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts} to \ref{table:abccare_rslt_female_counts_n10a10} of Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}, we document a large and precisely determined fraction of beneficial treatment effects well above $\frac{1}{2}$ for both genders for categories of outcomes spanning the life cycle through the mid 30s. At a 10\% level of significance, $46\%$ are statistically significant for females and $28\%$ for males (see Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive10}).

Figures~\ref{fig:ppositivehome} and~\ref{fig:ppositivealternative} adjust the count measures used to construct Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivenb} to analyze more clearly defined counterfactuals: treatment compared to staying at home and treatment compared to alternative center childcare. These comparisons indicate that males and females benefit differently from alternatives to high-quality treatment. Compared across all categories, females benefit more from treatment when compared to staying at home (as opposed to attending alternative childcare), while males benefit more from treatment when compared to attending an alternative childcare arrangement (as opposed to staying at home).

We also present estimates of the combining functions by outcome category. Figure~\ref{fig:cats-positive-significant} shows the estimated proportions that are statistically significantly positive at the 10\% level. Consistent with the treatment effects above, control-group females tend to do better in alternative childcare than at home. This is especially true for parental income (induced by the childcare benefits of the program), IQ, education, and employment. Control-group males, on the other hand, do better at home, with more positive treatment effects compared to low-quality childcare.
