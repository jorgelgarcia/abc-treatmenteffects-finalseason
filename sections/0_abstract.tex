\noindent This paper studies the life-cycle impacts of a high-quality, intensive, and widely emulated early childhood program that started early in life (at 8 weeks of age) and had a randomized design. This program, like many, generates a variety of treatment effects. We construct a variety of aggregate statistics of treatment effects. Girls have more statistically significant treatment effects than boys and the magnitudes are generally bigger. The source of this difference is worse control-group conditions for girls resulting from more severe socio-economic disadvantage at baseline. Fathers of sons are more likely to support the spouse than fathers of daughters. \textbf{[Word count: 99 words]}
