\noindent This paper studies the life-cycle impacts of a high-quality, intensive, influential, and widely emulated early childhood program that started early in life (at 8 weeks of age) and had a randomized design. Upon the impracticality of analyzing the dozens of outcomes available to evaluate the program one at the time and the need to avoid cherry-picking outcomes with significant treatment effects, we propose parametric and non-parametric tests to aggregate and summarize treatment effects. We document that girls benefit more than boys. The source of this difference is worse control-group conditions for girls resulting from more severe socio-economic disadvantage at baseline. \textbf{[Word count: 100 words.]}
