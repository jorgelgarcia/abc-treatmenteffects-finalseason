This paper examines the impacts by gender of two closely related and influential early childhood programs: the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and its sister program, the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE), henceforth ABC/CARE. Both were evaluated by the method of random assignment. While specific categories of outcomes of ABC/CARE have been studied, our paper is the first to aggregate and summarize all of the reported outcomes to evaluate the program.

ABC/CARE was conducted in Chapel Hill, North Carolina for a sample of children born between 1972 and 1980. It was a pioneering program that focused on the early years of disadvantaged children. It is a template for many current and proposed early childhood programs.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are currently being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on the ABC/CARE approach. The programs are: the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP)---eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes (CLIO) study \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Educare programs are also based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}.} It started at 8 weeks of age and continued through age 5. Treatment and control children were followed through their mid 30s, with data collected on multiple dimensions of human development with over 100 reported program outcomes.\footnote{Previous studies presenting treatment effects of ABC and CARE include \citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE,Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ,Campbell_Pungello_etal_2001_DP,Campbell_Ramey_etal_2002_ADS,Anderson_2008_JASA,Campbell_Wasik_etal_2008_ECRQ,Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}. Only \citet{Heckman_2006_Science}, \citet{Anderson_2008_JASA} and \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} note separate treatment effects by gender. \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} only use health data, and find that men are more affected by ABC/CARE than women. \citet{Anderson_2008_JASA} constructs factors using data up to the age-21 collection and finds that women benefit more than men, but does not use the crime, health, and employment data used in our paper. }

To avoid cherry-picking and reporting outcomes with ``significant'' treatment effects, we analyze aggregates of treatment effects. Table~\ref{table:summary} previews our analysis. Consider education for which we observe four outcomes (e.g., labor income at ages 21 and 30). In the control group, all of the average outcomes are greater for males if compared to females. This is denoted by the fraction $1.000$. We provide an exact, non-parametric test in which the null hypothesis is that the joint distribution of these four outcomes is the same for males and females and find that the $p$-value is $0.117$.\footnote{Details on the inference on the fraction and the exact, non-parametric test are provided below.} The analogous statistics for the treatment group yield a fraction of $0.75$ and a $p$-value of $0.080$. This indicates that treatment reduces the gaps between males and females. The treatment-control difference between the treatment male-female gap and control male-female gap is $0.25$. However, the post-treatment joint distribution of employment outcomes still differs according with our exact, non-parametric test. Table~\ref{table:summary} reveals that the pattern described for employment generally holds for all of the outcomes that we study.\footnote{This finding of females benefitting more than males (except in health) is consistent with previous work studying the gender differences in early childhood education. We survey the literature in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-survey}. See \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for a discussion of the main findings from the literature on early childhood education. Not reporting gender differences is a common practice. Examples include \citet{Bernal_Keane_2011_JoLE,Cascio_Schanzenbach_2013_ImpactsExpandingAccess,Bitler_et_al_2014_Head_Start_Unpublished,Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}. There are some exceptions: \citet{Anderson_2008_JASA,Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE,Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.}

\item \textbf{Note:} Column [1] lists the outcome category. The outcomes in each category are listed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}. Column [2] lists the number of outcomes that we observe within each category. Column [3] lists the proportion of outcomes for which the average for males is greater than the average for females for the control group. $1.000$ denotes that all average outcomes are greater for males than for females. $0.000$ denotes the opposite. A proportion is bold when it is significantly differs from $0.50$ at the 10\%, so both $1.000$ and $0.000$ could be significant. The relevant null hypothesis is $0.50$ because the number of outcomes for which the average is greater for males than for females is the same than the number in which the opposite happens if the fraction is $0.50$. For inference, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the proportions over 1,000 bootstraps. For bootstrap $b \in [1, \ldots, 1,000]$ we compute the proportion of variables in each outcome category for which the male average is greater than the female average and then obtain a non-parametric $p$-value. Column [4] displays an exact, non-parametric test in which the null hypothesis is that the joint distribution of the outcomes within each category is the same for the control group. Column [5] is analogous to column [3] for the treatment group. Column [6] is analogous to column [4] for the treatment group. Column [7] is the difference between columns [5] and [3] and the inference procedure is analogous to that in column [3]. Column [8] is analogous to column [3] but performs a test pooling the control and treatment groups.

While females benefit more than males from treatment and these closes the pre-treatment male-female gaps, both males and benefit from the program. We describe these benefits using parametric and non-parametric aggregates of outcomes across the life cycle. All measures consistently show beneficial effects of the program.

The differential treatment effects by gender arise because control-group girls grow up in less favorable environments compared to control-group boys. Specifically, in the homes of girls, fewer fathers are present and maternal education and IQ are lower. Girls in the control group who stay at home ($27\%$ of the control-group girls), were raised in more disadvantaged environments. Girls who went to preschools other than ABC/CARE ($73\%$ of the control-group girls), likely went to lower-quality preschools because their families were more resource constrained compared to their male counterparts for whom more fathers are present.\footnote{We do not have precise measures of the quality of individual alternative preschools, although we do know that girls were more disadvantaged. This implies that their families would have fewer resources to send them to relatively better alternative preschools.} Thus, girls benefited more from treatment because they would have otherwise grown up in more disadvantaged environments.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev} show that the quality of the available alternatives was of lower quality than the treatment offered through ABC/CARE. We supplement this evidence with historical records showing that even the alternatives that followed state and federal standards of the era were of lower quality than ABC/CARE as measured by concrete measures such as staff-child ratios. We provide more detail on the quality of ABC/CARE and the alternative options in Section~\ref{sec:data} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}.}

There is an important difference in the within-gender take-up of alternatives (families randomized to the control group have multiple child care alternatives). Among control-group girls, the more disadvantaged stayed at home. Among control-group boys, the relatively advantaged boys are more likely to stay at home instead of attending the lower-quality preschool alternatives. \textbf{[JJH: Is this associated with lower mother's working?][JLG: We are providing a whole description of this in Section 5.]}

These results are confirmed when we explicitly account for control group substitution. Boys benefit more from ABC/CARE when compared to alternative preschools given their relatively better home environments. Girls benefit more from ABC/CARE when compared to home-based care, given that those who stay at home are more disadvantaged.

%ABC/CARE greatly benefits children by providing an enriching environment to complement their home environments.  Dissecting the counterfactual brings our results to a modern context in which many children are enrolled in preschool, and in which low-quality center-based care is abundant, especially for children from socio-economic disadvantaged backgrounds.\footnote{Approximately 60\% of preschool-age children regularly receive non-parental childcare \citep{FIFCFS_2009_Wellbeing_REPORT}. At age 4, the child care break down for disadvantaged children, which compose 13\% of all children in the US \citep{USCB_2014_CoverageReport}, was the following. Head Start: 29\%; Non-Head Start center-based: 26\%; relative care: 15\%; non-relative care: 5\%; parental care: 25\%. While the quality of Head Start centers and family day care arrangements is constant across disadvantaged and advantaged children, the quality of the rest of arrangements is considerably and consistently lower for disadvantaged children \citep{FIFCFS_2009_Wellbeing_REPORT}.} Quality matters and low-quality programs could cause harm. This sounds a cautionary note for advocates of early childhood programs in any form.

A companion paper, \citet{Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}, presents a cost-benefit analysis of ABC/CARE. It presents a monetized summary of program treatment effects. While more statistically significant treatment effects are found for girls, the outcomes for boys produce a greater reduction of social costs, resulting in a larger rate of return for men relative to women.

Our analysis unfolds in the following way. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes our experimental data. We document the quality level of the alternative childcare that a considerable proportion of the control-group subjects attended. Section~\ref{sec:parameters} defines the treatment effects we estimate and how we summarize them. Section~\ref{sec:treatment-effects} reports the treatment effects overall and by gender and establishes the existence of sharp gender differences for many categories of outcomes. Section~\ref{sec:gender-differences} discusses the sources of these differences. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
