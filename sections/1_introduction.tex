Differences in gender are central features of economic and social life. This paper investigates how participation in enriched early childhood programs differentially affects the lives of disadvantaged boys and girls, and whether it promotes or reduces gender gaps. We show that, on many outcomes, low-quality childcare programs harm boys and contribute to gender gaps. This analysis sounds a cautionary note for advocates of early childcare in any form. Quality matters and low-quality programs can cause harm.

There is a rich literature in psychology on the greater vulnerability of boys to adverse life conditions and the importance of fathers in the lives of boys.\footnote{See \citet{golding2016psychology}.} As a group, girls mature earlier, are more resilient to adversity, and perform better in a variety of life tasks.\footnote{See \citet{Schore_2017_IMHJ} for an informative overview of this literature. Economists have contributed to this literature. See, e.g., \citet{Bertrand_Pan_2013_AEJAE}, \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects}, and \citet{Autor-etal_2015_Family-Disadvantage}.} Less is known about effective strategies for reducing the vulnerability of boys to disadvantage.

Many studies have shown the benefits of early-life interventions for improving the skills of children, especially those from disadvantaged families.\footnote{\citet{Currie_2011_AER,Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}.} Although several of these studies report effects by gender, most do not.\footnote{We survey the literature in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-survey}. See \citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu} for a discussion of the main findings from the literature on early childhood education. Not reporting gender differences is common. Some examples include \citet{Bernal_Keane_2011_JoLE,Cascio_Schanzenbach_2013_ImpactsExpandingAccess,Bitler_et_al_2014_Head_Start_Unpublished,Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}. There are some exceptions: \citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE,Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.} Pooling males and females ignores potentially large differences in treatment effects.

This paper investigates this issue using data from a randomized controlled trial of a prototypical intensive early childhood program that enriched the early lives of disadvantaged children. The data come from the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and its closely aligned sister program, the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE). These programs were conducted in Chapel Hill, North Carolina for a sample of children born between 1972 and 1980. In this paper, we refer to the combined programs by the acronym ABC/CARE. It is a template for many current and proposed early interventions.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are currently being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on the ABC/CARE approach. The programs are: IHDP---eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start in the U.S. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes (CLIO) study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Educare programs are also based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}.} It starts at 8 weeks of age and continues through age 5. Treatment and control subjects are followed through their mid 30s, with data collected on multiple dimensions of human development.

There are positive impacts of the program across the life cycle for both genders. However, there are substantial differences in impacts by gender across domains. The program differentially promotes the labor income, employment, and health of males and reduces their participation in crime. It differentially enhances the cognition, achievement, and educational attainment of girls. Boys placed in childcare benefit relatively more than girls from participation in high-quality center-based care compared to low-quality center-based care.

Our analysis sheds light on recent claims about the harm caused by enrolling children in childcare programs. In an influential analysis, \citet{Baker_Gruber_etal_2008_JPE} show that participants in childcare manifest adverse behavioral outcomes. \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects} localize their effects to boys.

However, all childcare programs are not alike. We produce evidence that high-quality childcare greatly benefits boys relative to low-quality childcare. Staying at home is a better option for them, especially if the family environment is relatively advantaged (e.g. the father is present). This effect is not found for girls. The program analyzed by \citet{Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects} and \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects} is of relatively low quality compared to the enriched program we analyze.\footnote{The program they analyze was a modest payment (between 5 and 7 Canadian dollars a day starting in 1997) in the form of a voucher. The voucher component itself reduces received quality given an information problem by parents. The full cost of the program was \$44 (2014) a day \citep{Baker_etal_2005_Universal_Childcare_NBER}. This is less than two thirds of the cost of ABC/CARE, which was close to \$75 (2014) a day \citep{Garcia_Heckman_Leaf_etal_2017_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.} There is no contradiction between the claim that low-quality programs impair child development, while high-quality programs do not. Boys are more vulnerable and respond adversely to low-quality environments on many outcomes.

Unlike previous studies, we estimate treatment effects comparing treatment group outcomes to different control groups: home care or care in low-quality centers.\footnote{Historical documentation, records, and evidence from knowledgeable individuals indicate that although the available alternative centers followed state and federal standards, they were of considerably lower quality than the ABC/CARE program. We document this in Appendix~\ref{app:control-subbb}.}$^,$\footnote{Previous studies presenting treatment effects of ABC and CARE include \citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE,Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ,Campbell_Pungello_etal_2001_DP,Campbell_Ramey_etal_2002_ADS,Campbell_Wasik_etal_2008_ECRQ,Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}.} We find that home care is beneficial for boys compared to low-quality center childcare.

To preview our analysis, we present gender differences in outcomes in Table~\ref{tab:proportion-table-ranksign}. We report the proportion of outcomes, by category, for which males outperform females (we have multiple outcome measures in each category which we explain in greater detail below). These proportions are invariant to the scales used for individual measures. Under the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effects by gender, the proportion of outcomes favoring any gender should be 50\%. We test this hypothesis for the control group and the treatment group separately to determine whether there is a baseline (control) gender difference and whether treatment affects this gender difference.

Pooling the two control groups, males have higher IQs, employment, enhanced parental labor income (through subsidized childcare), and are more likely to participate in criminal activity than females. They do better on an aggregate over all categories. Treatment reverses the gap between males and females in the pooled control group for achievement. All achievement measures favor males in the pooled control group, but favor females in the treatment group. Education is another outcome category for which treatment reverses the gender gap between treatment and a pooled control group. Males have higher educational attainment in the pooled control group with 66.7\% of the educational outcomes favoring males, although the result is not statistically significant. In the treatment group, however, only 11.1\% of the educational outcomes favor males. Treatment reverses the gap for an aggregate across all outcome categories and narrows the gap for employment.

\item Note: This table summarizes comparison of gender gaps across outcome categories by different groups. A bold proportion for the treatment or control group indicates that the proportion is statistically different than 50\% at the 10\% level. A bold difference between treatment and control indicates that the Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the control and treatment proportions, over 1,000 bootstraps, yields a $p$-value less than or equal to 0.10. The variables for each outcome category are listed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:gdiff-tes}. The inference procedure is described in detail in Appendix~\ref{little-gdiff-proportions}. In summary, we bootstrap with replacement 1,000 times. For bootstrap $b \in [1, \ldots, 1,000]$ we compute the proportion of variables in each outcome category for which the males do better than the females. We do this separately for the treatment and control group, estimating the pair of proportions $(P_{T,b}, P_{C,b})$. Over the distribution of the pairs, we compute the signed-rank test. It compares the empirical distribution of the proportions in the treatment group to the empirical distribution of the proportions in the control group. We repeat this procedure for each outcome category.

Table~\ref{tab:proportion-table} summarizes the gender gaps reported in Table~\ref{tab:proportion-table-ranksign}, as well as those for different childcare environments for control-group children. In the control group, the proportion of outcomes for which males do better than females is higher than 50\% for most of the categories, although not all are statistically significant. Exceptions include social-emotional skills, risky behavior, and crime, in which females surpass males.\footnote{Females commit fewer crimes and report less risky behavior in comparison to males.} Treatment reverses the gaps for achievement, education, employment, parental income, and overall outcomes. For controls who stay at home, females have slightly better health outcomes than males. The males who attend lower-quality childcare do not outperform females on any of the outcome categories associated with cognition, education, and induced parental labor income (through subsidy of childcare). These outcomes are concentrated relatively early in the life of a child, indicating an early-life disadvantage that enriched early childcare programs partially correct.

This paper unfolds in the following way. Section~\ref{sec:data} describes the experimental data we analyze and its special features. It documents that a considerable proportion of the control-group subjects attend lower-quality childcare compared to treatment subjects. Section~\ref{sec:parameters} defines the treatment effects we estimate and how we summarize them. Section~\ref{sec:treatment-effects} reports the treatment effects overall and by gender and establishes the existence of sharp gender differences for many categories of outcomes. Section~\ref{sec:gender-differences} discusses the sources of these differences. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
