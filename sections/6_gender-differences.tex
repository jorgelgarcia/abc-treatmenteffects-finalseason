\subsection{Possible Explanations for Gender Differences}

\textbf{[JJH: Way too much emphasis on CBA.][We changed this section to focus on the treatment effects.] [JJH: We need the moderation and mediator analyses.][We added moderation of the proportions shown in the introduction.]}

These treatment effects point to gender differences but do not explain the mechanisms through which they occur. An important factor at play is the issue of alternative preschool. There are substantial differences between males and females in one counterfactual: treatment vs. alternative preschools. The estimated treatment effects are very similar across genders for treatment compared to those staying at home full time. Males benefit much more from treatment relative to alternative preschools compared to their benefits from treatment relative to staying at home. This result is consistent with findings noted elsewhere: (i) stark gender differences resulting from attending low quality childcare \citep{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects,Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects}; and (ii) females are less sensitive to uncertain environments (see, e.g., \citealp{Autor-etal_2015_Family-Disadvantage}).

In the Introduction, we show the proportion of outcomes, by outcome category, for which the males exceed the females. Here, we further divide the control group by the alternative settings and both the treatment and control groups by father present, an important moderator. Figure~\ref{fig:proportion-altpre} shows the proportions dividing by alternative setting. The males who stay at home do better than the females in cognitive and parenting measures, employment, and across all outcomes. Unlike the males who attend alternative preschool, the males who stay at home have similar crime outcomes as the females. Given the prominence of the males' criminal activity, this finding highlights the magnitude of harm of the alternative preschools for the males.

Note: These plots show the proportion of outcomes, by outcome category, for which the males' mean is larger than the females' mean. The standard errors and the $p$-values are computed using 100 bootstraps. The $p$-values are one-sided and test the null hypothesis that the proportion of outcomes is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ The crime outcomes are all coded so that a higher value indicates more criminal activity. All other outcome categories have higher values corresponding to socially desirable outcomes.

We next divide by father present for both the treatment and control groups. When the father is at home, the males in the treatment group outperform their female counterparts in IQ and parenting. The treatment also does not widen the male-female gap in health for those with a present father, as it does for those with an absent father. In the control group, the father's presence is only distinguishing for crime, with males with a present father being less involved in criminal activity compared to those with an absent father.

In addition to a gender difference in alternative preschool experiences, there are gender differences in the experience of ABC/CARE treatment. We analyze this by looking at the specific effects of the intervention on parenting.\footnote{In this exercise, we use We use measurements of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME; \citet{Bradley-Caldwell_1977_AJMD}). Although the exact scales vary by age, the scales of the HOME measure generally measure maternal warmth and involvement, absence of punishment, provision of appropriate toys, encouragement of mature behavior and independence, and the physical and language environment. The full score is the sum of these scales.}

When graphing the density of a factor combining the parenting skills measured at different ages, the density of the treatment group in both the male and female subsamples is bimodal (Figure~\ref{fig:total-home}). Because this is not the case for the control group, it is possible that treatment is moderated by another input of home environment. We consider the input of father's presence because it is highly correlated with selection into alternative preschool. For males, the mean of the treatment group if the father is present is greater than that of the treatment group if the father is absent. The reverse is seen for the females.

\textbf{[JJH: Report results for controls (see comment 7a \& 7b). We need to deemphasize CBA. We are spoiling its market.][We have edited this section to discuss the gender differences in the treatment effects and the moderators and the control substitution. We will continue to add to this, including mediation.]}

%We explore this trend more closely in Figure~\ref{fig:total-home-quantiles}. To do so, we calculate the distribution pooling experimental groups but splitting by gender and father's presence. We then calculate, by gender and father's presence, the proportion of the treatment group that is in quantile 1 versus quantile 2. We do the same for the control group.

%Note: The horizontal axis divides a factor of the HOME scores into the first and second quantile of the distribution pooling across experimental groups, but splitting  by gender and father's presence. The factors are computed by gender using full HOME scores at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 8 years. The lower $p$-value tests that the treatment proportion is less than the control proportion within a quantile. The upper $p$-value tests that the treatment proportion is greater than the control proportion within a quantile. The numbers reported in the bars are the proportions. All standard errors and $p$-values are calculated using 1,000 bootstraps.
