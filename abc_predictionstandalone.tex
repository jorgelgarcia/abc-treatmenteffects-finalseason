\noindent \textbf{Prediction Methodology} \\

\noindent We consider a prediction problem and solve it combining experimental and non-experimental datasets. Let $S$ indicate of the dataset is experimental ($S=1$) or non-experimental ($S=0$). The objective is to predict an outcome of interest at time $t$, $Y_{t}$, which we do not observe in the experimental dataset but we do observe in the non-experimental dataset. For simplicity, think of this outcome as labor income, although this methodology accommodates for any type of outcome.\\

\noindent Let $\bold{X}_{t}$ be a set of variables potentially affected by treatment. Although there is no treatment in the non-experimental dataset, we observe $\bold{X}_{t}$ in both samples. It can include lagged and forward values of $Y_{t}$; let $\mathcal{B}$ be a vector of background variables (i.e., variables not affected by treatment or pre-treatment variables). $R$ is an indicator for treatment status ($R = 1$ treatment; $R = 0$ control). In the non-experimental sample, we do not observe $R$. In the experimental sample, we observe $R$ and we observe that: 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0} \text{ implies } \Pr \left( D = 1 | R = r \right) = 1, 
\end{equation}
