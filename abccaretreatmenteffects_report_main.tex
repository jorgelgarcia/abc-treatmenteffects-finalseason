\section{Background} \label{section:bakcground}
\subsection{Overview}

\noindent The Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) were both designed and implemented by full-time researchers and professional staff at the Frank Porter Graham Center (FPGC) of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The programs recruited very disadvantaged children from the semi-rural communities surrounding the area.\\

\noindent In both studies, the sample sizes were small: ABC recruited 122 children over four cohorts, while CARE recruited 65 children over two cohorts. ABC had two phases. The first phase began at birth and ended up at age 5. It randomly assigned children into either treatment or control. The treatment group received: (i) center-based childcare; (ii) breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, iron-fortified formula for the first 15 months of life, and a monthly supply of diapers; and (iii) medical care from licenses nurses supervises by a pediatrician, frequent health check-ups, and hospital referrals in case of need of serious medical treatment.The control group only received the formula and the diapers. The second phase began at age 5 and ended up at age 8. It randomly assigned the 95 children who remained in the program at age 5 into treatment or control, independently of their status in the second randomization. The treatment consisted of home visits targeting both children and parents.\\ 

\noindent The design and implementation in CARE and ABC were very close. CARE also had two stages, although children were randomized a single time and received the two treatment phases as a bundle. While the second stage was practically identical in the two programs, the first phase of CARE took a main departure from the first phase of ABC. The main objective from the departure  was to study the importance of improving the home environment on child development. CARE extended the design of ABC to include a family education program. The first phase of CARE was from birth up to up to age 5. Children were randomly assigned to either of three experimental groups: (i) control---23 children; (ii) family education---25 children; and (iii) family education and center-based childcare---17 children. As in ABC, the control group received diapers and complementary nutrition from birth to 15 months old. The second group received home visits that helped the parents to solve everyday problems that could interfere with the way in which they interacted with their children. Both treatment groups received the second phase of treatment from ages 5 to 8, just as the treatment group children in ABC.\\

\noindent Data availability is vast and very similar in both programs. In the first 8 years of life, yearly data on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environment, and family structure and economic conditions were collected. After age 8, the collection of data was scattered. Information on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, educaton, and family economic conditions was collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, information on cognitive skills is unavailable both in ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have two elements that are unique in the literature: administrative criminal records and a full medical sweep at age 34. These rich sources of data allow us to study the long-term effects on several aspects of human development.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria and Populations Served} \label{section:eligibility}

\noindent ABC recruited four cohorts of children, who were born in the years 1973 to 1977. CARE recruited two cohorts of children, who were born in 1978 and 1979. The recruitment process was identical. Potential families were referred by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mothers' last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility for inclusion was determined by a score of 11 or more on a weighted 13-factor High-Risk Index.\footnote{The HRI was based on 13 weighted variables. (i) maternal educational levels —years of education followed by weight in parentheses: ≤6 (8); 7 (7); 8 (6); 9 (3); 10 (2) 11 (1); ≥12 (0)— (ii); paternal educational levels —weights identical to scheme for mother’s education; (iii) family income —income bracket in current dollars followed by weight in parentheses: ≤1,000 (8); 1,001-2000 (7); 2,001-3,000 (6); 3,001-4,000 (5); 4,001-5,000 (4); ≥ 5,001 (0); (iv) father’s absence in the household for reasons other than health or death (weight = 3); (v) absence of maternal relatives in the area (weight = 3); (vi) siblings of school age one or more grades behind age- appropriate level, or with equivalently low scores on school-administered achievement tests (weight = 3); (vii) payments received from welfare agencies within past 3 years (weight = 3); (viii) record of father’s work indicates unstable or unskilled and semi-skilled labor (weight = 3); (ix) record of mother’s or father’s IQ indicate scores of 90 or below (weight = 3); (x) records of sibling’s IQ indicates scores of 90 or below (weight = 3); (xi) relevant social agencies in the community indicate the family is in need of assistance; (xii) one or more members of the family has sought counseling or professional help in the past 3 years (weight = 1); and (xiii) special circumstances not included in any of the above that are likely contributors to cultural or social disadvantage (weight = 1).} Table~\ref{table:} compares the ABC and CARE children with respect to the most representative elements in the HRI. The children in CARE were relatively less disadvantaged: their mothers were significantly more educated and worked more before pregnancy; their parents had more income total income.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: ABC vs. CARE Table]}.\\

\noindent Neither ABC nor CARE considered race as an eligibility factor. However, $98\%$ and $90\%$ of their participants, respectively, were African-American. Mean maternal age in ABC (CARE) when the target child was born was 19.9 (21) years, and approximately half of the mothers of both the treatment and control groups were 19 or younger.\footnote{Maternal age at target child’s birth ranges from 13 to 43 years of age. One-third were 17 or younger.} Mean maternal IQ for both treatment and control groups was approximately 85 (87 in CARE), one standard deviation below the national mean. Only $25\%$ of the ABC children lived with both biological parents, and more than $50\%$ lived with extended families in multi-generational households ($61\%$ of treated children and $56\%$ of control children).\\

\noindent  Note: These panels plot four variable characteristics---mother's age, mother's education, an indicator of father at home, and parental income (in thousands of 2014 USD). In each panel, the first bar shows the national-level for a cohort born in the same years as the ABC and CARE individuals (1973-1979), obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The second bar uses this same information but restricted to black individuals. The third and fourth bars plot the same variables for ABC and CARE, pooling the treatment and control groups. We display the sample size for each calculation in parentheses next to the horizontal axis labels.

\end{figure}

\noindent To better understand the socio-economic status of the ABC participant families, we construct two comparison groups using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a nationally representative cohort of the children born in the same years as the ABC and CARE children (1973-1979), and a similar cohort restricted to black children. We show a comparison in Figure~\ref{figure:baselineabccare}. Compared to both nationally representative groups, ABC children were, on average, significantly more disadvantaged; they were born to younger, less educated mothers, most of whom were raising their children without the support of a father, and the total parental labor income was extremely low due to the father not being at home and the low human capital of mothers. The participants of CARE were also disadvantaged compared to nationally representative groups with respect to basic household socio-demographic characteristics.\\

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises}

\subsubsection{ABC}

\noindent The first-phase randomization was paired at the family level. This implied jointly randomizing a pair of siblings and a pair of twins to either treatment or control.\footnote{The two siblings in the pair were close enough in age as for both of them to be eligible to the program.} Although we know that the pairing was based on HRI, maternal characteristics, number of siblings, and gender, we do not knows the original pairs. In total, 120 were part of the study. As discussed below, our calculations indicate that 112 families participated of the initial randomization, while 8 families became part of the program as replacement for the families that withdrew.\\

\noindent There were some compromises to first-phase randomization. One control children participated of the program and three children in the treatment group did not participate, by decision of their families. We have information on these children and their families from birth and up the end of elementary school. Four families moved out out from the area before any data on them was collected. Only data during their adulthood is available. Two children in the control group were swapped to treatment at the request of local authorities, because they were considered at high-risk of being developmentally delayed. Other two children in the control group were dropped because they were diagnosed with developmental delay, which made them ineligible for the program. Most of the data for these last four control children is available from birth and up to elementary school. Finally, four children died before age 5, two in the control group and two in the treatment group.\footnote{The two control children died from at 3 and 18 months from cardiomyopathy and seizure disorder and a cardiac arrest, respectively. One child in the control group died at 3 months old from crib, while the other died in a pedestrian accident at 50 months old \citet{}.} Based on this, we classify 14 children as cases of attrition. Table~\ref{table:} compares their baseline characteristics with the baseline characteristics of the children who complied to the first-phase randomization.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: Compliers vs. Attriters Table]}\\

\noindent The children who stopped participating of the program before they were 6 months old were replaced. These children were: (i) two who died; (ii) one who withdrew; and (iii) one who was diagnosed with developmental delay.\footnote{Three replacements are documented in \citet{•}. One is documented in correspondence with the program officers, which is available from the authors of this document upon request. The rest are implied by the number of children who participated of the randomization in each cohort.} This gave a final first-phase sample of 111 children, 53 treatment children and 58 control children.\\

\noindent At the moment of the second-phase randomization, 3 children in the control group of the first phase and 3 children in the treatment group of the first phase stopped being followed. One child in the control group and 8 children in the treatment group of the first phase did not participate of the second phase but later agreed to participate of the data collections during adulthood. This yielded a sample of 96 children, who were randomized to treatment (49) and control (47), independently of their status in the second phase. Three children in the control group did not comply to the randomization protocol by not participating, while all children in the control group complied to their treatment status. Figure~\ref{fig:abc-flow} illustrates the randomization protocol for the two phases of the program.

Note: The variable R represents randomization into treatment [R=1] or control [R=0] groups.

\noindent While there was balance in observed, baseline characteristics between the children in the treatment and control groups in the two randomization phases (see Table~\ref{table:}), the explained compromises pose a methodological challenge that we assess when calculating the effects the program for all the outcomes and across all the ages for which we have data. We develop this further in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: balance in observed characteristics for all both phases.]}\\

\subsubsection{CARE}

\noindent The randomization protocol in CARE was analogous to the first-phase randomization protocol in ABC. Importantly, it had no major compromises. Of the initial 65 families, 23 were randomized to control, 25 to family education treatment, and 17 to family education and center-based childcare treatment. Two families in the family education treatment group had twins. As in ABC, the twin children were jointly randomized. After randomization, the family of one child initially assigned to the family education and center-based childcare treatment refused its status and did not participate of the program. Within the first six months of treatment, a child assigned to this same group left the study due to family reallocation. Finally, one child who was assigned to the family education treatment group died. Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} illustrates the CARE's randomization and the flow of participants throughout the data follow-ups.\\

Arrows pointing outside the diagram indicate children that left the study permanently. The variable P represents participation in the respective programs. Both the treatment groups continued into school-age with a home visitation program that was not randomized. We use the term temporary attrited for children who did not participate in the study at school age, but were later interviewed in the age-21 followup.}

\end{center}


\subsection{Treatment Substitution}

\noindent In both programs, many children who did not have access to center-based childcare by random assignment were enrolled by their parents into alternative preschools. Clarifying this is fundamental: it changes the meaning of simple comparisons between children in the control and the treatment groups, and poses a methodological challenge when answering policy-relevant questions. We document take-up of alternative preschool here and propose a methodology to answer relevant policy-questions in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{output/abc_controlcontamination_months.eps}
\floatfoot{
\footnotesize
\noindent Note: This figure displays the cumulative density function of enrollment in alternative preschool for the control group in ABC.}
\end{figure}

\noindent In ABC, $70\%$ of children enrolled in either of 11 local center-based childcare centers (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubabc}). All of these centers received federal subsidies and thereby were regulated by the Federal Interagency of Daycare Requirements. Their staff was required to be trained in early childhood education and the centers were required to implement curricula designed to enhan ce cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children \footnote{}. In CARE, two of the experimental groups did not receive center-based childcare as part of treatment by design, the control and the family education treatment groups. Little more than $70\%$ from the  former and $60\%$ from the latter were enrolled in alternative preschool by their parents, to the same set of local center-based childcare centers as the ABC children in the control group (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare}).\\

\end{figure}
 


\subsection{Program Description and Content}

\noindent In the following lines, we describe ABC and CARE comparatively. Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison} summarizes how the programs compare.\\

\input{output/abccare_programcomparison.tex}

\noindent ABC and CARE shared a main, initial objective: to prevent mental retardation by enhancing development from birth and foster school readiness for disadvantaged children.\footnote{•} The different curricula implemented at center-based childcare across programs and cohorts has the following common goals: (i) support language, mother, and cognitive development; (ii) develop socio-emotional competencies that were considered to enable school readiness---e.g. task orientation, emotional self-expression, independence, sharing, and cooperation. The curricula evolved each year, based on studies done by the programs' staff on children's data.\footnote{A brief comparison to other early childhood education curricula is the following. The curricula implemented in the first phases of ABC and CARE and Tools of Mind share emphasis on self regulation---e.g., goal setting and self-reflection--- and opportunities for language development. Language development, including phonics and reading skills, is also an important element in other widely implemented curricula sun as Opening the World of Learning.}${^{\text{,}}}$\footnote{Two other renowned early childhood education programs are worth comparing to ABC and CARE. The Infant Health and Development Project (IHDP) was based on the first phase of CARE. IHDP had a single treatment group, which was very similar to the center-based childcare and family education treatment group of CARE. The curricula implemented both and home and at center-based childcare were very similar. The main difference is that the first phase of CARE lasted 5 years, while IHDP lasted 3 years and it had not second phase. Both ABC and CARE were notably different from the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program. NFP had fewer visits and it began in the pre-natal period. Mothers received monthly visits during pregnancy and one visit every two months once the child was born and up to age 2. The visitors were nurses and they tried to help women to build relationships with friends and family, to create a support network for their children. A common element of the three programs is that the visitors helped parents to use community resources when solving their everyday problems.}\\

\noindent Both treatment groups in CARE had home visits. The main objective of this component was to help identify and think of solutions to parents' everyday problems that could adversely affect the relationship they had with their children. It was meant to improve the skills necessary for parents to raise their children. Usually, the home visits were weekly and one hour long. From birth and up to age 3, the participants of the family education and center-based childcare and family education groups received, on average, 2.5 and 2.7  visits a month. At ages 4 and 5, the average frequency diminished to 1.4 and 1.1 visits per month, respectively.\\ 

\noindent The first phases of ABC and CARE were conducted in conjunction with a longitudinal medical research study on infectious respiratory diseases in group environments. This allowed the children to have comprehensive medical care in the same center in which they received center-based childcare. The children who attended the center received daily screenings to detect sign of illness. This included all the children in the treatment group of ABC and all the children in the center-based childcare and family education group of CARE. The first cohort of the control group of ABC also received frequent medical check-ups during the first year of the first-phase of the program.\\

\noindent The children assigned to treatment in the first phase of ABC also received primary pediatric care by a family nurse practitioner and a licenses practical nurse, who were supervised by a pediatrician who was on continuous duty at the center-based childcare center. This care consisted of wellness check-ups, immunizations, parental counseling, and initial assessments of illnesses. As the rest of the treatment, pediatric care was free of charge. It included immunizations and basic medicines; any further prescriptions were not covered. Unfortunately, no documentation or correspondence evidences whether this part of the treatment was available for either of the treatment groups of CARE.\\

\noindent All participants center-based childcare in both programs were provided breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack. This were planned by a nutritionist. Children in the control groups of both programs received diapers from birth and up to when they were 3 years old, and an unlimited supply of bottled formula from birth and up to 15 months old.\footnote{None of the control groups of  ABC or CARE or the family education treatment group of CARE received any medical care. As explained above, an exception was the first cohort of the control children in ABC.}\\

\noindent The children in ABC where subject to a second randomization protocol, and where assigned to either treatment or control independently of their status in the first-phase. The children in CARE were not subject to a second randomization protocol. Instead, both the family education and the center-based childcare and family education treatment groups were given second-phase treatment. The control group of the first phase kept being the control group of the second stage. The second-phase or school-age treatment lasted for the first three year of elementary school and consisted of home visits by a teacher. The objective of the visits was to increase exposure to reading and mathematics and to promote parental involvement in the learning process. The visits happened every two weeks in the presence of the parents. The teachers discussed the children's programs with the parents. In addition, they helped parents with issues related to literacy, housing, and medical care.\\ 

\subsection{Data}

\noindent The data collection processes in ABC and CARE were analogous by design. The treatment and control groups were followed into adulthood with relatively low attrition. For ABC, children were followed-up annually through elementary school and and at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30. Health and administrative crime data were collected when the children reached their mid-30s. For CARE, the exact same follow-ups are available except for the 15 years-old one.\\

\noindent Information on the children’s developmental progress, schooling, home environment, and diverse characteristics on the parents was recorded through early childcare and elementary school, and at age 21. The data include measures of each child’s IQ, achievement test scores, health, risky behaviors, schooling, social interactions, socio-emotional status, and non-cognitive skills; family and household variables; and parents’ labor market participation, income, IQ, schooling, and attitudes toward child-rearing. For ages 21 and 30, information on labor market outcomes, income, educational attainment, relationship histories, health status, household status, risky behaviors, and criminal activity is available.\\

\noindent For ABC, information is available on 100 children in the age 30 follow-up, which we call the adult follow-up. In addition, 88 participants (45 and 43 from the control and treatment groups respectively) consented to release their criminal records and information on a full-range biomedical sweep is available (for 31 and 39 participants of the control and treatment groups, respectively). Examples of the information in the health data include prevalence of diabetes and high blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, height and weight, and cholesterol levels. For CARE, the data is similarly available (see Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow}). In Appendix~\ref{appendix:data} we find no differences on observed characteristics between the individuals for whom we have crime and health data for both programs.
