\section{Background} \label{section:bakcground}
\subsection{Overview}

\noindent The Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) programs were both designed and implemented by full-time researchers and professional staff at the Frank Porter Graham Center (FPGC) of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The programs targeted very disadvantaged children from the semi-rural communities in the surrounding area.\\

\noindent In both studies, the sample sizes were small: ABC recruited 122 children over four cohorts,\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject}} while CARE recruited 65 children over two cohorts. ABC had two phases, the first of which lasted from birth until the age of 5. Children were randomly assigned to either treatment or control. The treatment group received: (i) center-based childcare; (ii) breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, iron-fortified formula for the first 15 months of life, and a monthly supply of diapers; and (iii) medical care from licensed nurses who were supervised by a pediatrician, frequent health check-ups, and hospital referrals when serious medical treatment was needed.The control group only received formula and diapers. At the age of 5, the 95 remaining children were randomly assigned to treatment or control, independent of their status in the prior randomization, for the second phase of treatment which lasted until the age of 8. The treatment consisted of home visits targeting both children and parents.\\ 

\noindent The design and implementation of CARE and ABC were very similar. CARE also had two stages, but children were only randomized once and received the two treatment phases as a bundle. While the second stage was practically identical in the two programs, the first phase of CARE differed significantly from the first phase of ABC by including a family education program. The main objective of this component  was to study the importance of improving the home environment on child development.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}} The first phase of CARE lasted from birth until the age 5. Children were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: (i) control---23 children; (ii) family education---25 children; and (iii) family education and center-based childcare---17 children. As in ABC, the control group received diapers and complementary nutrition from birth to 15 months. The second group received home visits that helped the parents solve everyday problems that could have interfere with the way in which they interacted with their children. Both treatment groups received the second phase of treatment from ages 5 to 8.\\

\noindent The data available on both programs is rich and very similar. From birth until the age of 8, data was collected annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environment, and family structure and economic conditions. After age 8, the collection of data was less regular. Information on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, educaton, and family economic conditions was collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, information on cognitive skills is unavailable for both ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have two sources of data that are unique in the program-evaluation literature: administrative criminal records and a full medical sweep at age 34. These rich sources of data allow us to study the long-term effects of the programs on numerous aspects of human development.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria and Populations Served} \label{section:eligibility}

\noindent ABC recruited four cohorts of children born between 1973 and 1977.\footnote{\citet{Feagans_1996_Childrens-Talk}} CARE recruited two cohorts of children, one  born in 1978 and one in 1979. The recruitment processes were identical. Potential families were referred by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother's last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was determined by a score of 11 or more on a weighted 13-factor High-Risk Index.\footnote{The HRI is based on 13 weighted variables, which are listed here with weights in parentheses: (i) maternal educational level measured by years of education - ≤6 (8), 7 (7), 8 (6), 9 (3), 10 (2), 11 (1), ≥12 (0); (ii) paternal educational levels with weights identical to those for maternal education; (iii) family income measured in current dollars - ≤1,000 (8), 1,001-2000 (7), 2,001-3,000 (6), 3,001-4,000 (5), 4,001-5,000 (4), ≥ 5,001 (0); (iv) father’s absence from the household for reasons other than health or death (3); (v) absence of maternal relatives in the area (3); (vi) siblings of school age one or more grades behind age-appropriate level, or with equivalently low scores on school-administered achievement tests (3); (vii) received payments from welfare agencies within past 3 years (3); (viii) record of father’s work indicates instability or unskilled and semi-skilled labor (3); (ix) record of maternal or paternal IQ score of 90 or below (3); (x) record of sibling IQ score of 90 or below (3); (xi) relevant social agencies in the community indicate the family is in need of assistance (MISSING WEIGHT); (xii) one or more family members has sought counseling or professional help in the past 3 years (1); and (xiii) special circumstances not included in any of the above that are likely contributors to cultural or social disadvantage (1).} Table~\ref{table:} compares the ABC and CARE children with respect to the elements of the HRI that are most representative of socio-economic risk. The children in CARE were relatively less disadvantaged: their mothers were significantly more educated and worked more before pregnancy, and their parents had a higher total income.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: ABC vs. CARE Table]}.\\

\noindent Neither ABC nor CARE used race as an eligibility factor. However, $98\%$ and $90\%$ of their participants, respectively, were African-American.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD},\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1984_AJMD},\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty},\citet{Campbell_Pungello_etal_2001_DP}} Mean maternal age in ABC (CARE) when the target child was born was 19.9 (21) years, and approximately half of the mothers of both the treatment and control groups were 19 or younger.\footnote{Maternal age at target child’s birth ranges from 13 to 43 years of age. One-third were 17 or younger.} Mean maternal IQ for both treatment and control groups was approximately 85 (87 in CARE), one standard deviation below the national mean. Only $25\%$ of the ABC children lived with both biological parents, and more than $50\%$ lived with extended families in multi-generational households ($61\%$ of treated children and $56\%$ of control children).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty},\citet{Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}}\\

\end{figure}

\noindent To better understand the socio-economic status of the ABC participant families, we construct two comparison groups using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a nationally representative cohort of the children born in the same years as the ABC and CARE participants (1973-1979), and a similar cohort restricted to black children. We show a comparison in Figure~\ref{figure:baselineabccare}. Compared to both nationally representative groups, ABC children were, on average, significantly more disadvantaged; they were born in households with extremely low total parental income and to younger, less educated mothers, most of whom were raising their children without the support of a father. The CARE participants were similarly disadvantaged compared to nationally representative groups with respect to these basic household socio-demographic characteristics.\\

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises}

\subsubsection{ABC}

\noindent The first-phase randomization was paired at the family level, so pairs of siblings and twins were jointly randomized to either treatment or control.\footnote{Sibling pairs occurred when the two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that the pairing was based on HRI, maternal characteristics, number of siblings, and gender, we do not knows the original pairs. In total, 120 families took part in the study. As discussed below, our calculations indicate that 112 families participated in the initial randomization, while 8 families became part of the program as replacement for the families that withdrew.\\

\noindent There were some compromises to first-phase randomization. One control child participated in the program and three children in the treatment group did not participate due to the decisions of their families. We have information on these children and their families from birth until the end of elementary school. Four families moved out of the area before any data on them was collected and only data from adulthood is available. Two children in the control group were swapped into treatment at the request of local authorities, because they were considered to be at high-risk of developmental delay. Two additional children in the control group were dropped because they were diagnosed with developmental delay, which made them ineligible for the program. Most of the data for these last four control children is available from birth until elementary school. Finally, four children died before age 5 \footnote{One child in the control group died at 3 months from cardiomyopathy and seizure disorder, and a second child in the control group died at 18 months from a cardiac arrest. One child in the treatment group died at 3 months from crib death, while the other died in a pedestrian accident at 50 months \citet{Ramey_Campbell_1984_AJMD}} Based on this, we classify 14 children as cases of attrition. Table~\ref{table:} compares their baseline characteristics with the baseline characteristics of the children who complied to the first-phase randomization.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: Compliers vs. Attriters Table]}\\

\noindent The children who stopped participating in the program before they were 6 months old were replaced. \footnote{Three replacements are documented in \citet{•}. One is documented in correspondence with the program officers, which is available from the authors of this document upon request. The rest are implied by the number of children who participated of the randomization in each cohort.} Thus, the final first-phase sample consisted of 111 children (53 treatment children and 58 control children).\\

\noindent Prior to the second-phase randomization, 3 children in the control group of the first phase and 3 children in the treatment group of the first phase stopped being followed. One child in the control group and 8 children in the treatment group of the first phase did not participate in the second phase but later agreed to participate in the data collections during adulthood. This yielded a sample of 96 children, who were randomized to treatment (49) and control (47), independently of their status in the first phase. Three children in the control group did not comply with the randomization protocol by not participating, while all children in the control group adhered to their randomization status. Figure~\ref{fig:abc-flow} illustrates the randomization protocol for the two phases of the program.

\end{center}

\noindent While there was balance in observed, baseline characteristics between the children in the treatment and control groups in the two randomization phases (see Table~\ref{table:}), the explained compromises pose a methodological challenge that we assess when calculating the effects the program for all the outcomes and across all the ages for which we have data. We develop this further in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\\

\noindent \textbf{[JLG: balance in observed characteristics for all both phases.]}\\

\subsubsection{CARE}

\noindent 
The randomization protocol in CARE was analogous to the first-phase randomization protocol in ABC. Importantly, it had no major compromises.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE},\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD},\citet{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}} Of the 65 initial families, 23 were randomized to control, 25 to family education treatment, and 17 to family education and center-based childcare treatment. Two families in the family education treatment group had twins who were jointly randomized as in ABC. After randomization, the family of one child initially assigned to the family education and center-based childcare treatment refused its status and did not participate in the program. Within the first six months of treatment, one child assigned to this same group left the study due to family reallocation. Finally, one child who was assigned to the family education treatment group died. Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} illustrates CARE's randomization and the flow of participants throughout the data follow-ups.\\

Arrows pointing outside the diagram indicate children that left the study permanently. The variable P represents participation in the respective programs. Both the treatment groups continued into school-age with a home visitation program that was not randomized. We use the term temporarily attrited for children who did not participate in the study at school age, but were interviewed in the age-21 followup.}

\end{center}


\subsection{Treatment Substitution}

\noindent Clarifying the instances of treatment substitution is critical because it impacts the interpretation of simple comparisons between children in the control and the treatment groups, and poses a methodological challenge when answering policy-relevant questions.
In both programs, many children who did not have access to center-based childcare by random assignment were enrolled by their parents into alternative preschools. We document the take-up of alternative preschool here and propose a methodology to answer relevant policy-questions in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\\

		\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{output/abc_controlcontamination_months.eps}
\floatfoot{
\footnotesize
\noindent Note: This figure displays the cumulative density function of enrollment in alternative preschool for the control group in ABC.}
\end{figure}

\noindent In ABC, $70\%$ of \textbf{[Sherry: control?]} children enrolled in one of 11 local center-based childcare centers (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubabc}). All of these centers received federal subsidies and were therefore regulated by the Federal Interagency of Daycare Requirements. Their staff members were required to be trained in early childhood education and the centers were required to implement curricula designed to enhance cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev}} In CARE, the control and family education treatment groups did not receive center-based childcare as part of the experimental design. However, slightly more than $70\%$ of the  former and $60\%$ of the latter were enrolled in alternative preschool by their parents, attending the same set of local center-based childcare centers as the ABC children in the control group (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare}).\\

\end{figure}
 


\subsection{Program Description and Content}

\noindent The ABC and CARE programs shared many objectives and program components, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison}.\\

\input{output/abccare_programcomparison.tex}

\noindent ABC and CARE had a common principle objective: prevent mental retardation by enhancing development from birth and foster school readiness for disadvantaged children.\footnote{Note that the clinical understanding of mental retardation was once associated with disadvantages that hindered early-life development \citep{Mental-Retardation_America_2004_BOOK_NYU}.} The different curricula implemented through center-based childcare across programs and cohorts had the following common goals: (i) support language and cognitive development; (ii) develop socio-emotional competencies that were considered to enable school readiness---e.g. task orientation, emotional self-expression, independence, sharing, and cooperation.\footnote{\citet{Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH},\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject},\citet{Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}} The curricula evolved each year based on studies of children's data completed by the programs' staff.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-etal_1975_AJoMD},\citet{Finkelstein_1982_Day_Care_YC},\citet{Haskins_1985_CD}}\footnote{The curricula implemented in the first phases of ABC and CARE, including Tools of Mind, shared an emphasis on self regulation---e.g., goal setting and self-reflection--- and opportunities for language development. Language development, including phonics and reading skills, is also an important element in other widely implemented curricula such as Opening the World of Learning.}\footnote{Two other renowned early childhood education programs are worth comparing to ABC and CARE. The Infant Health and Development Project (IHDP) was based on the first phase of CARE. IHDP had a single treatment group, which was very similar to the center-based childcare and family education treatment group of CARE. The curricula implemented both at home and at center-based childcare were very similar. The main difference is that the first phase of CARE lasted 5 years, while IHDP lasted 3 years and did not have a second phase. Both ABC and CARE were notably different from the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program. NFP had fewer visits and began in the pre-natal period. Mothers received monthly visits during pregnancy and one visit every two months from when the child was born until the age of 2. The visitors were nurses and they tried to help women build relationships with friends and family to create a support network for their children. A common element of the three programs is that the visitors helped parents use community resources when solving their everyday problems.}\\

\noindent Both treatment groups in CARE had home visits, with the main objectives of helping parents think about everyday problems that could adversely affect the relationship they have with their children and brainstorm solutions, as well as improving the general skills necessary for parenting. Usually, the home visits were weekly and one hour long. Between birth and the age of 3, the participants in the family education and center-based childcare and family education groups received, on average, 2.5 and 2.7  visits a month respectively. At ages 4 and 5, the average frequency decreased to 1.4 and 1.1 visits per month, respectively.\\ 

\noindent The first phases of ABC and CARE were conducted in conjunction with a longitudinal medical research study on infectious respiratory diseases in group environments.\footnote{\citet{Henderson-et-al_1982_NEJoM}} This allowed the children to have comprehensive medical care in the same center in which they received center-based childcare. The children who attended the center received daily screenings to detect any signs of illness. This included all the children in the treatment group of ABC and all the children in the center-based childcare and family education group of CARE. The first cohort of the control group of ABC also received frequent medical check-ups during the first year of the first-phase of the program.\\

\noindent The children assigned to treatment in the first phase of ABC also received primary pediatric care by a family nurse practitioner and a licensed practical nurse, who were supervised by a pediatrician who was on continuous duty at the center-based childcare center. This care consisted of wellness check-ups, immunizations, parental counseling, and initial assessments of illnesses. Like the other treatment components, pediatric care was free of charge. Unfortunately, there is no documentation or corresponding evidence of whether this part of treatment was available for either of the treatment groups of CARE.\\

\noindent All participants center-based childcare in both programs were provided breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack, planned by a nutritionist. Children in the control groups of both programs received diapers from birth until the age of 3, and an unlimited supply of bottled formula from birth until 15 months. None of the control groups of  ABC or CARE or the family education treatment group of CARE received any medical care, with the exception of the first cohort of the control children in ABC, as explained above. 

\noindent The children in ABC were subject to a second randomization protocol, when they were assigned to either treatment or control independently of their status in the first-phase. The children in CARE were not subject to a second randomization protocol. Instead, both the family education and the center-based childcare and family education treatment groups were given second-phase treatment. The control group of the first phase continued to be the control group of the second stage. The second-phase, also referred to as school-age treatment, lasted for the first three year of elementary school and consisted of home visits by a teacher. The objective of the visits was to increase exposure to reading and mathematics and promote parental involvement in the learning process. The visits happened every two weeks in the presence of the parents. The teachers discussed the children's programs with the parents and helped parents with issues related to literacy, housing, and medical care.\\ 

\subsection{Data}

\noindent The data collection processes in ABC and CARE were analogous by design. The treatment and control groups were followed into adulthood with relatively low attrition. For ABC, children were followed-up with annually through elementary school and and at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30. Health and administrative crime data were collected when the children reached their mid-30s. For CARE, the exact same follow-ups are available with the exception of the one at age 15.\\

\noindent Information on the children’s developmental progress, schooling, home environment, and diverse characteristics on the parents was recorded through early childcare and elementary school, and at age 21. The data include measures of each child’s IQ, achievement test scores, health, risky behaviors, schooling, social interactions, socio-emotional status, and non-cognitive skills; family and household variables; and parents’ labor market participation, income, IQ, schooling, and attitudes toward child-rearing. For ages 21 and 30, information on labor market outcomes, income, educational attainment, relationship histories, health status, household status, risky behaviors, and criminal activity is available.\\

\noindent For ABC, information is available on 100 children in the age 30 follow-up, which we call the adult follow-up. In addition, 88 participants (45 and 43 from the control and treatment groups, respectively) consented to release their criminal records and 70 participants consented to release information on a full-range biomedical sweep (31 and 39 participants from the control and treatment groups, respectively). Examples of the information in the health data include prevalence of diabetes and high blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, height and weight, and cholesterol levels. For CARE, the available data is similar (see Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow}). In Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}, we find no differences in observed characteristics between the individuals of both programs for whom we have crime and health data.

\section{Methodology} \label{section:methodology}

\subsection{Parameters of Interest and Policy Questions}

\noindent Randomized assignment to treatment does not itself guarantee that the simple estimates commonly used in the literature are able to answer policy-relevant questions. Estimators need to identify the effects of programs in comparison to the relevant alternatives in order for them to properly inform policy-making.\\

\noindent In this section, we outline the methodology for estimating relevant parameters of interest. First, we focus on a single phase of treatment and a single comparison between the control and a single treatment group. We then clarify how to extend our methodology to the second-phase treatment and to multiple treatment branches.\\

\noindent Let $Y_{1}$ denote the outcome when an individual is fixed to treatment and $Y_{0}$ denote the outcome when an individual is fixed to control. The standard way to evaluate the impact of a program is to compare the distributions of $Y_{0}$ and $Y_{1}$. That is, test the hypothesis 

\begin{equation}
H_{0}: Y_{0} \sim Y_{1}. \label{eq:ho}
\end{equation}

\noindent A common way to contrast this hypothesis is to test if the intent-to-treat (ITT) estimator is different from zero. The ITT is 

\begin{equation}
\text{ITT} = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right]. \label{eq:itt}
\end{equation} 

\noindent Under perfect compliance to treatment and control status, the ITT helps test \eqref{eq:ho} because $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right]$ identifies the expectation of the outcome $Y$ when the individual is fixed to treatment status. Similarly, $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right]$ identifies the expectation of $Y$ when the individual is fixed to control status. The ITT is the difference between the expectations of distributions of $Y_{0}$ and $Y_{1}$.

\noindent \begin{assumption} \normalfont (Perfect Compliance) Let $R$ indicate randomization to treatment and $D$ indicate treatment take-up. Perfect compliance occurs whenever  $R = D$.\end{assumption}

\noindent As we explain in Section~\ref{section:background}, compliance to treatment was not perfect. Thus, if we were to test the hypothesis in \eqref{eq:ho} using an estimate of the ITT, we would need to correct the estimates of $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right]$ and $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right]$ for non-compliance by addressing various situations in which we do not observe data on certain individuals originally assigned to either control or treatment status. This could be because their families refused to participate in treatment, moved to another city, or did not answer a specific questionnaire.\footnote{These instances of non-compliance are conceptually different, but we group them under the same correction. We could define a correction for each instance and arrive at a very similar method. In practice, it is not practical to distinguish between correction methods because each instance is present only a few times and our sample is small. Thus, we refer to non-compliance as any case in which data from the original assignment to treatment or control of an individual is missing.} \\

To see this, let $Y_d$ denote a counter-factual outcomes and $A$ denote compliance. Then, $Y_{d} \left(\text{fix } A = a \right)$ represents the counter-factual outcome $Y$ when $A$ is fixed to compliance ($A = 0$) or non-compliance ($A = 1$). \textbf{[Sherry: would it make more sense for $A=1$ to indicate compliance? Also, is writing the word "fix" in parentheses every time necessary, is it not implied?]} It is not necessarily the case that 

\begin{equation}
Y_{d} \left(\text{fix } A = 0 \right) \sim Y_{d} \left(\text{fix } A = 1 \right). 
\end{equation}

\begin{assumption} \normalfont \label{assumption:balance} (Conditional Independence in Non-compliance) The counter-factual outcome $Y_{d} \left(\text{fix } A = a \right)$ follows the same distribution regardless of the value on which $A$ is fixed, after condition on $X$ (observed characteristics): 

\begin{equation}
Y_{d} \left(\text{fix } A = a \right) | X \sim Y_{d} | X. 
\end{equation}

\end{assumption}

\noindent Under Assumption~\ref{assumption:balance}, however, we are able to correct our estimates of $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right]$ and $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right]$ for non-compliance by using an inverse-probability weighting (IPW) scheme. In other words, we reweight the data to obtain balance in the observed characteristics of individuals who complied and who did not comply to treatment. Assumption~\ref{assumption:balance} states that once $X$ is balanced, non-compliance does not affect the counter-factual distributions of interest so we are able to identify them.\footnote{We could relax Assumption~\ref{assumption:balance} if we were only interested in identifying the counterfactual expectations, as when we calculate the ITT. In that sense, Assumption~\ref{assumption:balance} is sufficient but not necessary. The weaker assumption of mean independence also suffices to identify the ITT.} Once we account for non-compliance, the ITT represents the average treatment effect of ABC, as implemented and not relative an specific preschool alternative. For clarity, we omit the argument $A$ henceforth, although in our empirical application we show estimates correcting for non-compliance.\\

\noindent Using the ITT to compare the treatment and the control groups in ABC is intended to identify the effect of ABC as it was implemented. However, the standard ITT does not account for the fact that $70 \%$ of control children enrolled in different preschool alternatives. Thus, this comparison only addresses its efficacy relative to the available supply when the program was implemented.\footnote{If the preschool alternatives were beneficial for the children in the control group, the ITT is attenuated towards zero. This is common in early childhood education programs in which alternatives are close in quality to the program itself. Perhaps the most iconic example is the randomized evaluation of Head Start, the Head Start Impact Study, in which $15\%$ of children in the control group had access to alternative Head Start centers. ITT estimates reported by \cite{Puma_Bell_etal_2010_HeadStartImpact} are close to zero. However, this does not mean that the efficacy of Head Start is low, but rather that Head Start treatment is being compared to close substitutes when computing the ITT.} The case is similar for CARE, when comparing each of its treatment groups to the control group.\\

\noindent To measure the impact of ABC as a program in itself, it is more relevant to ask what is the effect of treatment relative to a counter-factual scenario in which all children are fixed to the same alternative such as staying at home or attending a low-quality preschool. This question needs to account for treatment substitution by the control group because it requires the counter-factual for the control status to be fixed to a homogeneous alternative. By fixing the children in the control group to a level of alternative preschool, we enable the accurate comparison between the children in the treatment group and the children in the control group.\\

\noindent Let $P$ indicate if the child attended alternative preschool. The value of $P$ could either be fixed to no take-up of preschool alternative ($P = 0$) or take-up of preschool alternative $(P = 1)$. We want to contrast the following hypotheses: 

\begin{eqnarray}
H_{0}^A &:& Y_{0} \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right) \sim Y_{1} \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right) \\
H_{0}^B &:& Y_{0} \left( \text{fix } P = 1 \right) \sim Y_{1} \left( \text{fix } P = 1\right). 
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent That is, we want to compare the counter-factual treatment distributions when fixing children to no alternative preschool ($H_{0}^A$) and when fixing children to alternative preschool ($H_{0}^B$).\footnote{This treats alternative preschool as a binary decision, although it is continuous as we show in Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubabc}. We take this approach because we are limited by our sample size when predicting preschool take-up as we show in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methods}.}\\

\noindent To contrasts these hypotheses, consider the following estimators \textbf{[Sherry: Is there a typo - should $R=0$ for the second term in both equations?]}: 

\begin{eqnarray}
ITT \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right) &=& \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1, \text{fix } P = 0 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1, \text{fix } P = 0 \right] \label{eq:ittp0} \\
ITT \left( \text{fix } P = 1 \right) &=& \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1, \text{fix } P = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1, \text{fix } P = 1 \right]. \label{eq:ittp1}  
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Providing estimates for the expectations in \eqref{eq:ittp0}, \eqref{eq:ittp1} is not as straightforward as computing the expectations in \eqref{eq:itt}, because, while treatment fixes an individual to either treatment or control status, it does not fix either of the two alternative preschool statuses.\\

\begin{assumption} \normalfont (Conditional Independence in Preschool Alternatives Take-up) The counter-factual outcome $Y_{d} \left( \text{fix } P=p \right)$ follows the same distribution regardless of the value on which $P$ is fixed, after conditioning on $X$ (observed characteristics): 
\begin{equation}
Y_{d} \left( \text{fix } P=p \right) | X \sim Y_{d}  | X 
\end{equation}
 \end{assumption}

\noindent Assumption~\ref{assumption:matching} is a sufficient condition to provide estimates for \eqref{eq:ittp0}, \eqref{eq:ittp1}.  It states that the observed characteristics in $X$ account for the parental decision of whether or not to enroll the child in preschool alternatives.\\

\noindent The estimates for $ITT \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right) $ and $ITT \left( \text{fix } P = 1 \right)$ relate to the second policy question, which evaluates the efficacy of ABC. Once non-compliance is accounted for as explained above, the ITT estimates represent the average treatment effect of ABC relative to receiving no treatment at all and relative to receiving a preschool alternative.

\noindent For illustration, suppose we want to estimate the $ITT \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right)$ using a linear and separable parameterization. Then, estimate the following model 

\begin{equation}
Y = \Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right) + X \beta + \varepsilon, 
\end{equation}

\noindent which provides a consistent estimate for $\Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right)$ under Assumption~\ref{assumption:matching}. $\Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right)$ is the average treatment effect of ABC with respect to a well-defined alternative, no treatment at all. Note that Assumption~\ref{assumption:matching} is a sufficient condition for consistency, but a weaker condition (mean independence) suffices for identifying $\Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right)$. To account for non-compliance in this framework, we could weight the linear regression with individual-level estimates of the probability of compliance.\\

\noindent We present estimates of $\Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 0 \right)$ and $\Delta \left( \text{fix } P = 1 \right)$ using this parameterization and using other alternatives to more flexibly  condition on $X$, e.g. nearest neighbor matching, propensity score matching, and kernel-based weighting.
