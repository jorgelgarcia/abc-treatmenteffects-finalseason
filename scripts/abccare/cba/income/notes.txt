Weights for Matching (mset)

1: Baseline controls only (B’)			"Pre-treatment"
2: Non-baseline controls only (X’)		"Post-treatment"
3: Full set of controls (B’,X’)			"Pre- and Post-treatment"
4: No weights 

Specification of Projections (pset)
1: lag, B, X
2: B, X
3: lag, X
4: X
5: B
6: lag, B
7:
8: No weights, lag, B, X

Instructions on how to run pset types 1, 3, and 6

1. Navigate to filepath:
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income

2. Change variables to reflect desired pset

For type 1:
cols.interp.predictors = cols.interp.outcomes + cols.interp.background
cols.extrap.predictors = cols.extrap.outcomes + cols.extrap.background

For type 3:
cols.interp.predictors = cols.interp.outcomes
cols.extrap.predictors = cols.extrap.outcomes

For type 6:
cols.interp.predictors = cols.interp.background
cols.extrap.predictors = cols.extrap.background

3. Navigate to filepath:
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income/labor

3. Create a .h5 file with the prepared data 
$python2.7 setup_data_weights.py

4. Load .h5 file
$python2.7 load_data.py

5. Set other parameters

Bootstraps to some number N greater than 1
aux_draw = N 

For the t pset type in {1,3,6}
pset_type = t

control_sets = ['1','2','3','4'] 
or any subset of the mset numbers

6. Get predictions
qsub py_bootstrap_submit.sh


Instructions on how to run pset type 8

1. Navigate to filepath
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income

2. Make sure B and X variables are included in variables.py
cols.interp.predictors = cols.interp.outcomes + cols.interp.background
cols.extrap.predictors = cols.extrap.outcomes + cols.extrap.background

3. Navigate to filepath:
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income/labor

4. Create a .h5 file with the prepared data (with no weights)
$python2.7 setup_data.py

this file is saved in
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income/hdf5

5. Load .h5 file
$python2.7 load_data.py

6. Set other parameters

aux_draw = N

7. Get predictions
qsub py_bootstrap_submit_lag.sh

These save projections to
abccare-cba/scripts/abccare/cba/income/rslt/projections
