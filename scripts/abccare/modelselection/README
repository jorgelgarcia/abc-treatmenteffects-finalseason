This folder contains the code used to select the controls, instruments (if necessary---it is
possible that none are selected using model selection), and IPW variables.

'controls_selection.py' outputs 'best_controls.txt

'instruments_selection.py' outputs 'best_instruments.txt'

'ipw_selection.py' directly modifies the 'outcomes_cba.csv' file to include all the IPW variables
