This folder contains the flows for each component. We have many
diferent estimates, so each folder is for a specific estimate.

1. ncc_noctrl:	ITT, without controls, not accounting for control contamination, no IPW weights
2. ncc_ctrl:	ITT, with controls, not accounting for control contamination, no IPW weights
3. ncc_wctrl:	ITT, with controls, not accounting for control contamination, with IPW weights

4. p0_noctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=0, without controls, no IPW weights 
5. p0_ctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=0, with controls, no IPW weights 
6. p0_wctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=0, with controls, with IPW weights 
7. p0_match:	matching estimate fixing P=0, with IPW weights 

8. p1_noctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=1, without controls, no IPW weights 
9. p1_ctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=1, with controls, no IPW weights 
10. p1_wctrl:	regression on R conditional on P=1, with controls, with IPW weights 
11. p1_match:	matching estimate fixing P=1, with IPW weights
