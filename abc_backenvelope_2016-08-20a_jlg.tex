\subsection{Using our Estimates to Understand Recent Cost-benefit Analyses}

\noindent An example of the approach recent studies take on cost-benefit analyses is \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}. They use data of the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) to evaluate Head Start and find that its benefit/cost between $1.50$ and $1.84$.\footnote{HSIS is a one-year-long randomized version of Head Start.} They proceed in three steps: (i) calculate the treatment effect on Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at age 5; (ii) monetize this gain using the return to WPPSI at age 5 in terms of net present value of earnings at age 27 \citep{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}. Calculations from \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} indicate that a 1 standard deviation gain in WPPSI at age 5 implies a $13.1\%$ increase in the net present value of earnings at age 27;\footnote{This is based on combining information from Project Star and administrative data at age 27.} and (iii) calculate the benefit-to-cost ratio based on this gain and their own calculations of the program's cost. This calculation is based on assigning the net present value of earnings at age 27 of $\$385,907.17$ to the control-group participants, which is provided by  \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}.\footnote{All money values that we provide in this section are in 2014 USD.}\\

\item Note: This table displays displays benefit-cost ratios based on the methodology \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE} and based on our own methodology. Age: age at which we stop calculating the net-present value. NPV Source: source where we obtain the net present value. Component: item used to compute net present value (all refers to the net present value of all the components). \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}: estimate based on these authors methodology. Author's method: estimates based on our methodology.

\noindent To analyze how our estimates compares to the method in \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}, we present a series of exercises in the third column of Table~\ref{table:comparing}. For comparison, the fourth column of Table~\ref{table:comparing} displays the analogous exercise using our own method.\\

\noindent In the first exercise, we use both the ``return to WPPSI'' and the net-present value of earnings at age 27 in  \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}. In the second exercise, we perform a similar exercise but we use our own estimate of the net-present value of earnings at age 27.\footnote{This allows us to compute our own ``return to WPPSI'' and impute it to the treatment-group individuals.} The reminder of exercises are similar, but (i) vary the age up to where we consider the net-present value of earnings; (ii) consider the value of all the components we analyze throughout the paper; or (iii) both.\\

\noindent Our methodology has three gains: (i) provides a more precise estimate of the net-present value (and the return to WPPSI) of the components, as our interpolation and extrapolation is based on matching our experimental sample to various non-experimental samples. We do not impute a net present value or a return of an \textit{ad hoc} experiment; (ii) we better quantify the effects of the analyzed experiment by considering the whole life-cycle; (iii) we better approximate the statistical uncertainty of our estimates by considering both the sampling error in the experimental and non-experimental samples and the forecasting error due to the interpolation and extrapolation.
