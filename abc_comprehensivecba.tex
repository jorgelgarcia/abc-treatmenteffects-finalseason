\begin{abstract}
\noindent This paper estimates the large array of long-run benefits of an influential early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children and their families. It is evaluated by random assignment and follows participants through their mid-30s. The program is a prototype for numerous interventions currently in place around the world. It has substantial positive effects on (a) health and the quality of life, (b) the labor incomes of participants, (c) crime, (d) education, and (e) the earnings of the mothers of the participants through subsidizing their childcare. There are substantially greater monetized benefits for males. The overall rate of return is a statistically significant: 13\% per annum. The benefit/cost ratio is 5.6. These estimates account for the welfare costs of taxation to finance the program. They survive a variety of sensitivity analyses. Accounting for substitutes to treatment available to the experimental control group shows that boys benefit much less than girls from low quality alternative childcare.

\section{Introduction}

This paper documents the large array of life-cycle benefits of an influential early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children. The program has substantial impacts on the lives of participants. Monetizing benefits and costs across multiple domains, we estimate a rate of return of 13\% per annum and a benefit/cost ratio of 5.6 with substantial differences across genders, favoring males.

Our analysis contributes to a growing literature on the value of early programs for disadvantaged children.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Currie_2011_AER} and \cite{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}.} Long-term evidence on their effectiveness is surprisingly limited.\footnote{The major source of evidence is from the Perry Preschool Program (see \citealp{Schweinhart_Montie_ea_2005_BOOKlifetime} and \citealp{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn,Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}), the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) (\citealp{Ramey_Campbell_etal_2000_ADS,Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}), and the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) (\citealp{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth,Duncan_Sojourner_2013_JHR}). IHDP was inspired by ABC/CARE \citep[][]{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth}.} For want of follow-up data, many studies of early childhood programs report only a limited set of early age outcomes like IQ or scores on school readiness measures.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE} and \cite{Weiland_2013_CD_Impacts-of-Pre-K}.} Yet it is the long-term costs and benefits that are relevant for policy analysis.

We analyze the benefits from two virtually identical early childhood programs evaluated by randomized trials conducted in North Carolina. The programs are the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) -- henceforth ABC/CARE. Both were launched in the 1970s and have long-term follow-ups through age 34. The programs started early (at 8 weeks of life) and engaged participants to age 5. We analyze their impacts on a variety of life outcomes such as health, the quality of life,\footnote{Throughout this paper, \textit{we refer to health-related quality of life as quality of life}. It is the weight attached to each year of life as a function of disease burden, as we detail further below.} participation in crime, labor income, IQ, schooling, and increases parental earnings arising from subsidized childcare.\footnote{The income we observe is aggregated across the parents. Only 27\% of the mothers lived with a couple at baseline, so we refer to the gain in parental income as a gain in mother's labor income.}

Evidence from these programs is relevant for contemporary policy discussions because their main components are present in a variety of current interventions.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on the ABC/CARE approach. The programs are, with years launched and locations in parentheses: IHDP---eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start in the U.S. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes (CLIO) study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Educare programs are also based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}.} About 19\% of all African-American children are eligible for the program today.\footnote{43\% of African-American children were eligible in 1972.}

Analyzing the benefits of a program with a diverse array of outcomes across multiple domains and periods of life is both challenging and rewarding. Doing so highlights the numerous ways through which early childhood programs enhance adult capabilities. We use a variety of methodologies to characterize program benefits. Instead of reporting only individual treatment effects or categories of treatment effects, our benefit/cost analyses account for all aspects of the program, including the welfare costs of taxes to publicly finance the program. We display the sensitivity of our estimates excluding various components of costs and benefit.\footnote{\cite{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} present a cost/benefit analysis for ABC through age 21, before many benefits are realized. They report a benefit/cost ratio of 2.5, but give no standard error or sensitivity analyses for their estimate. They do not disaggregate by gender. For want of the data collected on health at age 34, they do not account for health benefits. They use self-reported crime data (unlike the administrative crime data later collected that we analyze) and ignore the welfare costs of financing the program. We use cost data from primary sources not available to them.}

A fundamental problem in evaluating any human capital intervention is assessing its out-of-sample future benefits. Most solutions to this problem are based on versions of a synthetic cohort approach using the outcomes of older cohorts comparable to treated and control persons to proxy future treatment effects.\footnote{\cite{Mincer_1974_schooling} addresses this problem using a synthetic cohort approach and provides evidence on its validity. See the discussion of the synthetic cohort approach in \cite{Heckman_Lochner_ea_2006_HEE}.} Using this approach, we combine experimental data through age 34 with information from multiple auxiliary panel data sources to predict benefits and costs over the lifetimes of participants.\footnote{\citet{Ridder_Moffitt_2007_hbk_metricsdata} provide a valuable discussion of data combination methods. These methods are related to the older ``surrogate marker'' literature in biostatistics (see e.g., \citealp{Prentice_1989_Surrogate_SiM}).}

Our analysis is simplified by the finding that all eligible families offered participation in the program take the offer. This motivates a revealed preference approach to constructing synthetic control groups. We develop a synthetic treatment group drawing on the analysis of \citet{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor}. They show that program treatment effects are produced through changes in inputs in a stable (across treatment regimes) production function for outcomes. We use the estimated production function to make out-of-sample predictions based on inputs caused by treatment.

We simultaneously account for sampling uncertainty from combining data, estimating parameters of behavioral equations, and simulating models. We conduct sensitivity analyses for outcomes for which sampling uncertainty is not readily quantified. Our approach to combining multiple data sets and analyzing blocks of outcomes is of interest in its own right as a template for evaluating other programs with numerous long-run outcomes using intermediate outcome measures.

Our analysis accounts for control group substitution.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_1992_randomization}, \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE}, and \cite{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}.} Roughly 75\% of the control-group children in ABC/CARE enroll in some form of lower quality alternative childcare centers.\footnote{We refer to alternatives as alternative childcare or alternative preschool centers. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for a precise description of these alternatives.} We define and estimate parameters accounting for the choices taken by the control groups in our study. We find pronounced gender differences in treatment effects comparing high quality treatment with lower quality alternatives. Males benefit much less from alternative childcare when compared with females, a result consistent with the literature on the vulnerability of male children.\footnote{See \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects,Autor-etal_2015_Family-Disadvantage,Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects}.}

We contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of early childhood programs by considering their long-term benefits on health. We estimate the savings in life-cycle medical costs and improvements in the quality of life.\footnote{\cite{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} show the substantial adult (age 34) health benefits of ABC but do not present a cost/benefit analysis of their results.} We also find substantial childcare benefits that promote work by the mothers of participants, and additional benefits for participants in terms of reduced crime, gains in life-cycle labor income, reduced special education costs and enhanced educational attainment.

Figure~\ref{figure:main} summarizes the main findings of this paper. It displays the discounted (by a 3\% discount rate) life-cycle benefits of the program and costs (in 2014 USD) for a pooled sample of male and female participants, both overall and disaggregated by category. Costs are substantial, as has frequently been noted by critics.\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{Whitehurst_2014_Senate_Testimony} and \citet{Fox_News_2014_Head_Start_Effects}.} But so are the benefits, which far outweigh the costs.

Note: This figure displays the life-cycle net present values per program participant of the main components of the cost/benefit analysis of ABC/CARE from birth to predicted death, discounted to birth at a rate of 3\%.  By ``net" we mean that each component represents the total value for the treatment group minus the total value for the control group. Program costs: the total cost of ABC/CARE, including the welfare cost of taxes to finance it. Total net benefits: are for \textit{all} of the components we consider. These include labor income: total individual labor income from ages 20 to the retirement of program participants (assumed to be age 67). Parental income: total parental labor income of the parents of the participants from when the participants were ages 1.5 to 21. Crime: the total cost of crime (judicial and victimization costs). To simplify the display , the following components are not shown in the figure: (i) cost of alternative preschool paid by the control group children parents; (ii) the social welfare costs of transfer income from the government; (iii) disability benefits and social security claims; (iv) costs of increased individual and maternal education; (v) total medical public and private costs. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We indicate point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.\\
*Labor Income results by gender indicate a statistically significant net present value of $\$308,825$ (2014 USD) for males; this value is $\$50,580$ (2014 USD) for females and it is not statistically significant.\\
**QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years. Any gain corresponds to better health conditions until predicted death, with $\$150,000$ (2014 USD) as base value for a year of life.\\}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The rest of the paper justifies and interprets these estimates. We proceed in the following way. Section~\ref{section:background} discusses the ABC/CARE interventions. Section~\ref{section:methodsquestions} presents our notation and the treatment effects estimated in this paper. Section~\ref{section:methodology} discusses our approaches to inference for vectors of treatment effects. We use combining functions that summarize the \emph{number} of beneficial outcomes, as well as the number of statistically significant beneficial outcomes. Section~\ref{section:c-functions} reports estimated treatment effects.

We summarize multiple program treatment effects using benefit/cost and rate of return analyses, which give economically interpretable summaries of the program and its components. Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} presents our approaches for predicting life-cycle outcomes and evidence supporting the assumptions underlying it. Section~\ref{section:cbaresults} reports our estimates of benefit/cost ratios and rates of return.

Section~\ref{section:conclusion} summarizes the paper. There are substantial benefits that differ by gender. In terms of treatment effects, females benefit across more domains. However, the monetized value of the treatment effects is substantially greater for males. This discrepancy is largely driven by labor income and health benefits, as well as reduced crime for males. Males benefit less than females from being placed in lower quality alternative early childcare programs.

\section[Background and Data Sources]{Background and Data Sources} \label{section:background}

\subsection{Overview}

ABC/CARE targeted disadvantaged predominately African American children in Chapel Hill/Durham, North Carolina.\footnote{Both ABC and CARE were designed and implemented by researchers at the Frank Porter Graham Center of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.} Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison} presents an overview and compares the two virtually congruent programs. Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} describes these programs in detail. Here, we summarize their main features.

The goals of these programs were to enhance the early-life skills of disadvantaged children. The program supported language, motor, and cognitive development as well as socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task-orientation, ability to communicate, independence, and pro-social behavior.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.}

The program individualized treatment. Each child's progress was recorded and learning activities were appropriately adjusted every 2 to 3 weeks. Environments were organized to promote pre-literacy and access to a rich set of learning tools.\footnote{The ``LearningGames'' approach was implemented by infant and toddler caregivers in 1:1 child-adult interactions. Each ``LearningGames'' activity states a developmentally-appropriate objective, the necessary materials, directions for teacher behavior, and expected child outcome.} The curriculum emphasized active learning experiences, dramatic play, and basic ideas of order and category (``pre-academic skills''), as well as discipline and the ability to interact with and respect others.  At later ages (3 through 5), the program focused on the development of ``socio-linguistic and communicative competence.''\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Haskins_1985_CD, Ramey_1981_Modification, Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree,Sparling_Lewis_1984_BOOKLearningGamesThreesFours}.}

ABC recruited four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1976. CARE recruited two cohorts of children, born between 1978 and 1980. The recruitment processes for each study were identical. Potential participant families were referred to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother's last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was determined by a score on a childhood risk index.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for details on the construction of the High Risk Index. Maternal education, parental IQ, presence of the father, family income, and father's job stability are its major components.}

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison}, the design and implementation of both ABC and CARE were very similar. ABC had two phases, the first of which lasted from birth until age 5. In this phase, children were randomly assigned to treatment. The second phase of the study consisted of child academic support through home visits from ages 5 through 8. CARE consisted of two treatment phases as well, very similar to ABC. The first phase of CARE from birth until age 5 had an additional treatment arm of home visits designed to improve home environments.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} The second phase randomized in ABC, but not in CARE.

Our analysis is based on the first phase and pools the treatment group in CARE with the ABC treatment group. We do not use the data on the CARE treatment group that only received home visits. \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} and \citet{ABCCARE_Dataset} show that there is no statistically significant effect of the CARE family education component alone. The second-phase treatment of ABC/CARE had very weak, if any, effects (for evidence, see \citealp{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} and \citealp{ABCCARE_Dataset}). \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} establish the validity of pooling the data across the second arms of the experiments.

\textbf{[Typist: Table now corrected]}

\end{table}

For both programs, from birth until the age of 8, data were collected annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environments, family structure, and family economic characteristics. After age 8, data on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, education, and family economic characteristics were collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, measures of cognitive skills are unavailable for both ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have access to administrative criminal records and a physician-administered medical survey at age 34. This allows us to study the long-term effects of the programs along multiple dimensions of human development.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{appendix:data} for a more comprehensive description of the data. There, we document the balance in observed baseline characteristics across the treatment and control groups, once we drop the individuals for whom we have no crime or health information, for which there is substantial attrition. Further, the methodology we propose addresses missing data in either of these two outcome categories.}

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises} \label{section:randomization}

Randomization for ABC/CARE was conducted on child pairs matched on family background. Siblings and twins were jointly randomized into either treatment or control groups.\footnote{For siblings, this occurred when two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that the randomization pairing was based on a risk index, maternal education, maternal age, and gender of the subject, we do not know the original pairs. ABC collected an initial sample of 122 subjects. We characterize each missing observation in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:attrition}, we document that our estimates are robust when we adjust for missing data using standard methods. We conduct the same analysis for the CARE sample. 22 subjects did not stay in the program through age 5.

\subsection{Control Group Substitution}

In ABC/CARE, many control group members attended alternative childcare or preschool arrangements.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE} on the issue of substitution bias in social experiments.} The figure is \treatsubsabc\ for ABC and \treatsubscarec\ for CARE. Figure~\ref{fig:salmonella} shows enrollment by age and the average months of enrollment by age for the control-group children who enrolled in program alternatives. Enrollment increases with the age of children.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare_2} shows the proportion of the sample enrolled in an alternative at a given age who persist in alternative care at the next age. Once enrolled, they stay enrolled, and children generally go for a full year.  Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare} shows (for each program) the cumulative distribution of the proportion of the first five years that control subjects were enrolled in alternatives. Figure~\ref{fig:proportion-alt-pre} shows the distribution of time spent in the alternative program for all control group participants.

Children in the control group who attend alternatives are less economically disadvantaged at baseline compared to children who stay at home. Disadvantage is measured by maternal education, maternal IQ, Apgar scores at minutes 1 and 5, and the high-risk index defining ABC/CARE eligibility. Children who attend alternatives have fewer siblings. On average, they are children of mothers who are more likely to be working at baseline.\footnote{Statistically significant at 10\%.} Parents of females are much more likely to use alternatives if assigned to the control group.\footnote{See Table~\ref{table:controlsubscharacteristics} in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for tests of differences across these variables between children in the control group who attend and who do not attend alternative preschools.}

Most of the alternatives received federal subsidies and were subject to the federal regulations of the era.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:tetanus} discusses the federal standards of that day. See \citet{Department-of-Health_1968_DayCareRequirements,NCGA_1971_House-Bill-100,Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} They had relatively low quality compared to ABC/CARE.\footnote{When we compare ABC/CARE treatment to these alternatives, ABC/CARE has substantial treatment effects. Further, as we argue below, parents perceived that ABC/CARE was superior to the alternatives.} The access of control-group children to alternative programs affects the interpretation of estimated treatment effects, as we discuss next.
\section{Notation and Parameters Studied in This Paper} \label{section:methodsquestions}

Random assignment to treatment does not guarantee that conventional treatment effects answer policy-relevant questions. In this paper, we define and estimate three parameters that address different policy questions.

We assume that life cycles consist of $T+1$ discrete periods. The treatment phase is the first $\bar{t}$ periods of life $\left[0,\dots,\bar{t}\right]$. We have data through age $t^{*}>\bar{t}$. We lack follow-up data on the remainder of life $(t^*,\dots,T]$. We define $W=1$ to indicate that parents wish to participate in the program.\footnote{Individual subscripts are omitted to improve clarity.} $R \in \{0,1\}$, where $R=1$ indicates that a child is randomized into eligibility to participate in the program. $D$ indicates participation in the program.

Individuals are eligible to participate in the program if baseline background variables $\bm{B}\in\mathcal{B}_0$. $\mathcal{B}_0$ is the set of scores on the high risk index (HRI) required to be eligible, as previously discussed. As it turns out, in the ABC/CARE study, all of the eligible persons ($\bm{B}\in\mathcal{B}_0$) given the option to participate choose to do so $(W=1\text{, and } D=R)$.\footnote{There are no cases of non-compliance for people offered treatment, although there is a small amount of attrition. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for details and Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} for evidence indicating that these cases minimally bias our results.} Thus, we can safely interpret the treatment effects generated by the experiment as average treatment effects for the population for which $\bm{B}\in\mathcal{B}_0$ and not just treatment effects for the treated (\textbf{TOT}). There are very few dropouts from the program. \emph{Ex ante}, parents perceived that ABC/CARE was superior to other childcare alternatives.

Let $\bm{Y}^1_t$ be the outcome vector for the treated. $\bm{Y}^0_t$ is the outcome vector for the control. In principle, life-cycle treatment effects for the controls can depend on the exposures to treatment or to the various alternatives at each age. It would be desirable to estimate treatment effects for each possible exposure but our samples are too small to make credible estimates for such detailed exposures.

We simplify the analysis by creating two categories of control status. ``$H$'' indicates that the child is in home care throughout the entire length of the program. ``$C$'' indicates that the child was in an alternative childcare for any amount of time. We test different categorizations in our empirical analysis reported below.

We thus compress a complex reality into two counterfactual outcome states at age $t$ for control group members:
\begin{align*}
\bm{Y}_{t,H}^0 \quad &: \quad \textbf{ Subject received home care exclusively} \\
\bm{Y}_{t,C}^0 \quad &: \quad \textbf{ Subject received some alternative childcare}.
\end{align*}

We define $V$ as a dummy variable indicating participation by control-group children in an alternative preschool. $V=0$ denotes staying at home. We write the outcome when a child is in control status as

\begin{equation}
\bm{Y}^0_t : = \left( 1 - V \right) \bm{Y}^0_{t,H} + \left( V \right) \bm{Y}^0_{t,C}. \label{eq:meandiff}
\end{equation}

One parameter of interest addresses the question: what is the effect of the program as implemented? This is the effect of the program compared to the next best alternative as perceived by the parents and is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:effect}
\bm{\Delta}_t := \mathbb{E} \left[ \bm{Y}^1_t -  \bm{Y}^0_t | W =1 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[\bm{Y}^1_t - \bm{Y}^0_t | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right],
\end{equation}
where the second equality follows because everyone eligible wants to participate in the program. For the sample of eligible persons, this parameter addresses the effectiveness of the program relative to the quality of all alternatives available when the program was implemented, including staying at home.

It is also fruitful to ask: what is the effectiveness of the program with respect to a counterfactual world in which the child stays at home full time? The associated causal parameter for those who would choose to keep the child at home is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:influenza}
\bm{\Delta}_t \left(V = 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ \bm{Y}^1_t - \bm{Y}^0_t | V = 0, W = 1 \right] := \mathbb{E} \left[\bm{Y}^1_{t} - \bm{Y}^0_{t,H} | V = 0, \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right].
\end{equation}
It is also useful to assess the average effectiveness of a program relative to attendance in an alternative preschool for those who would choose an alternative is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:smallpox}
\bm{\Delta}_t \left( V =1 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ \bm{Y}^1_t - \bm{Y}^0_t | V = 1, W = 1 \right] := \mathbb{E} \left[\bm{Y}^1_t - \bm{Y}^0_{t,C} | V = 1, \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right].
\end{equation}

Random assignment to treatment does not directly identify \eqref{eq:influenza} or \eqref{eq:smallpox}. Econometric methods are required to identify these parameters. We characterize the determinants of choices and our strategy for controlling for selection into ``H'' and ``C'' below.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:vsensitivity} displays results with alternative definitions of $V$ (i.e., different thresholds define if a child attended alternative preschool). The results are robust to the various definitions.}

\section{Summarizing Multiple Treatment Effects} \label{section:methodology}

ABC/CARE has rich longitudinal data on multiple outcomes over multiple periods of the life cycle. Summarizing these effects in an interpretable way is challenging.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} presents step-down $p$-values for the blocks of outcomes that are used in our benefit/cost analysis which we summarize in this section (\citealp{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat} and \citealp{Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}).} Simpler, more digestible summary measures are useful for understanding the main empirical regularities in our data. This section discusses our approach to summarizing vectors of treatment effects using combining functions that count the proportion of treatment effects by different categories of outcomes.

Consider a block of $N_l$ outcomes indexed by set $Q_l = \{1,\dots,N_l\}$. Let $j \in Q_l$ be a particular outcome within block $l$. Associated with it is a mean treatment effect
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{j,t} : = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y^1_{j,t} - Y^0_{j,t} | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0 \right].
\end{equation}

We assume that outcomes can be ordered so that $\Delta_{j,t} >0$ is beneficial.\footnote{All but 5\% of the outcomes we study can be ranked in this fashion. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} for our classification.} We summarize the estimated effects of the program on outcomes within the block by the number of positive counts within block $l$:
\begin{equation}
C_l = \sum^{N_l}_{j=1} 1 (\hat{\Delta}_{j,t} >0).
\end{equation}
The proportion of beneficial outcomes in block $l$ is $C_l / N_l$.\footnote{In our empirical application we consider all the outcomes as a block, and then different blocks grouped according to common categories---e.g., skills, health, crime.}

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the set of blocks. Under the null hypothesis of no treatment effects for all $j \in Q_l, l \in \mathcal{L}$, and assuming the validity of asymptotic approximations, $C_l / N_l$ should be centered around $1/2$. We bootstrap to obtain $p$-values for the null for each block and over all blocks. We also count the individually beneficial treatment effects that are statistically significant in the sets of outcomes across each of the groups indexed by the set $Q_l$. Using a 10\% significance level, on average 10\% of all outcomes should be ``significant'' at the 10\% level even if there is no treatment effect of the program. We provide evidence against both null hypotheses.\footnote{We present $p$-values for these hypotheses and a number of combining functions by outcome categories in Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}.}

Combining counts across all blocks enables us to avoid (i) arbitrarily picking outcomes that have statistically significant effects---``cherry picking''; or (ii) arbitrarily selecting blocks of outcomes to correct the $p$-values when accounting for multiple hypothesis testing.

\section{Estimated Treatment Effects and Combining Functions}\label{section:c-functions}

ABC/CARE has a multiplicity of treatment effects corresponding to all of the measures collected in the multiple waves of the longitudinal surveys.\footnote{For estimates of treatment effects for each outcome analyzed, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}.} Reporting these treatment effects in the text would overwhelm the reader. Here we report estimates of the main treatment effects that underlie our benefit/cost and rate of return analyses.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} reports treatment effects and step-down $p$-values for all the outcomes analyzed. These account for multiple hypothesis testing as in \citet{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat,Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}.}

Evidence from ABC/CARE and many other early childhood programs is often criticized because of their small sample sizes.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Murray_2013_GivingKids_JJHBOOK}.} An extensive analysis reported in \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} shows that asymptotic inference and small sample permutation-based inference closely agree when applied to ABC/CARE data. For this reason, we use large sample inference throughout this paper.\footnote{Unless otherwise specified, the inference we present throughout the paper is based on $1,000$ draws from the empirical bootstrap distribution. $p$-values are one-sided, non-parametric. We highlight values when estimates are significant at $10\%$. For estimations using combining different datasets, we bootstrap all datasets and combine them to form bootstrap draws. We bootstrap at the individual level, i.e. we ``block'' bootstrap at the individual level given the longitudinal data of our experimental and non-experimental datasets. Inference based on permutation tests is available on request.} We adjust all estimates for sample attrition using Horvitz--Thompson \citeyearpar{Horvitz_Thompson_1952_JASA} inverse probability estimators (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:attrition} for details).

We account for control group substitution using a variety of econometric procedures: (a) matching, (b) instrumental variables, and (c) control functions (selection estimators). We rely on matching to generate the main estimates of \eqref{eq:influenza} and \eqref{eq:smallpox} in this paper because the available instruments and exclusion restrictions are weak.\footnote{We present estimates based on kernel matching. A full set of results based on propensity score matching generates similar results and is available under request.} Estimates from all of these procedures are in rough agreement, although the standard errors associated with IV and control function estimators are large. For further discussion, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:amethodology}.

\subsection{Estimated Treatment Effects}

Table~\ref{table:tescombined} presents the following estimates. Column (1): mean difference between treatment- and control groups. Column (2): adjusts the difference for attrition and controls for background variables. These two are estimates of \eqref{eq:effect}. Column (3): mean difference between treatment- and the control-group children who did not attend alternatives. Column (4): matching estimator for  \eqref{eq:influenza}. Column (5):  mean difference between treatment- and control-group children who attended alternatives. Column (6): matching estimator for \eqref{eq:smallpox}.

The results for females show that ABC/CARE had effects on employment and labor incomes of participants as adults, high school graduation, years of education, and the income of the participants' parents. It reduces participant arrests. These results strengthen when we compare treatment with the alternative of staying exclusively at home.

The results for males are different. Treated subjects reported lower drug use and blood pressure. There are also effects on labor income and education. The results for employment, hypertension, and blood pressure are strengthened when comparing the treatment group to those subjects who attend alternative childcare centers. Separation from the mother and being placed in relatively low quality childcare centers have far more deleterious consequences for males than for females.\footnote{This is consistent with the evidence in \citet{Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects} and \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects}.} The results hold under alternative definitions of take up of alternatives by control-group children (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:vsensitivity}).

We account for the following background variables ($\bm{B}$): Apgar scores at minutes 1 and 5 and the high-risk index. We define the high-risk index in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} and explain how we choose the control variables in Appendix~\ref{appendix:bvariables}. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We highlight point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.

\subsection{Estimated Combining Functions}

We next report estimates of the proportion of beneficial effects by block and overall.\footnote{We consider a total of 95 outcomes that we classify in Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}. These are the outcomes that most clearly relate to the treatment offered by the program.} The analysis is based on treatment effect \eqref{eq:effect}. Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} displays the results from this analysis: ABC/CARE positively impacted a large percentage of the outcomes. We show the counts for treatment compared to the next best alternative chosen by parents in Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivenb}. Proportionately more outcomes are beneficial for females, but the proportions are high for both groups and well above the benchmark of 1/2. In Tables~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts} to \ref{table:abccare_rslt_female_counts_n10a10} of Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}, we show that for categories of outcomes spanning the life cycle through age 34, including a wide variety of health categories, a large and precisely determined fraction of beneficial treatment effects are positive and well above one half for both genders.

Using an $\alpha$-level of significance, one would expect to find that $\alpha\%$ of the treatment effects are ``statistically significant,'' even if the null hypothesis of no effect of the program is true simply by chance. For a 10\% level of significance, $46\%$ are statistically significant for females and $28\%$ for males (see Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive10}).

Figures~\ref{fig:ppositivehome} and Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivealternative} adjust the count in Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivenb} to analyze more clearly defined counterfactuals: treatment compared to staying at home and treatment compared to alternative preschool. This comparison indicates that females and males benefit differently from alternatives to high quality treatment. As is the case for the treatment effects reported in Table~\ref{table:tescombined}, females benefit more from treatment compared to staying at home while males benefit more from treatment compared to attending an alternative childcare arrangement, but not compared to staying at home. Males benefit much less from lower quality alternative child care arrangements than females.\footnote{These results are consistent with the analysis of \citet{Rutter_1972_Maternal-Deprivation}, who shows that at early ages, males are more adversely affected than females by absence of the mother.}

\section{Predicting and Monetizing Life-cycle Costs and Benefits}\label{section:cbamethodology}

\textbf{[JJH: Insert Jorge's materials here, but keep mine as a separate document for today.] [Typist: Per your directions and Jorge's guidance, we have inserted his updated section in this updated version of the paper, and have printed the old version of JUST Section 6 of the paper for your reference.] [JJH: Please print] [Typist: It has been included in the bag again]}

A central focus of this paper is summarizing the multiple benefits of ABC/CARE using benefit/cost and rate of return analyses. This requires using non-experimental data to predict the costs and benefits of the program over the life cycle after the measurement phase of the study ends. This is a fundamental problem in empirical social science that has been addressed in the literature in multiple ways.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Heckman_Lochner_ea_2006_HEE}. \citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn} use a variety of methods to predict future labor income in the Perry Preschool Project. The various methods are in general agreement. They fit a variety of panel data labor income dynamics models and project future labor income with them.} This section explains our strategy for using multiple data sources to predict the out-of-sample life-cycle costs and benefits of education, labor income, transfer income, crime, and health. Our approach builds on and extends the analysis of \citet{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor}, who show that, in a similar setting to ours, the effect of treatment on outcomes operates through its effects on inputs in a stable production function rather than through shifts in the production function. We report a similar finding for ABC/CARE.

To construct cost-benefit estimates we (i) \textit{interpolate} components not observed due to intermittent data collection; and (ii) \textit{extrapolate} (predict) components not observed because the latest follow-up is from when the subjects were in their mid-30s. We use multiple sources of non-experimental data representative on the national or state level to construct these interpolations and extrapolations. Table~\ref{table:sources} presents the outcomes for which we conduct these analyses and the data sources we use. We use labor income as an illustrative example, but our methodology is the same for predicting the rest of the outcomes unless otherwise noted.\footnote{We use labor income as an illustration in this section because the life-cycle patterns are well-known in the literature and it is straightforward to compare the experimental and non-experimental samples. We predict transfer income using the same procedure. See Section~7 for results.}

\subsection{Using Auxiliary Data Sources to Predict Outcomes Out of Sample}\label{sec:usingaux}

This subsection gives an informal summary of our prediction procedure, and tests of its underlying assumptions. The rest of Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} presents a formal justification for our approach, as well as tests of key assumptions. Readers not interested in formal models can skip to Section~\ref{section:cbaresults}, where we discuss the results.

We have data on control- and treatment-group individuals through age $t^{\ast}$. We lack information on participant outcomes afterward. Yet, post-$t^{\ast}$ outcomes are required to construct counterfactual life-cycle profiles. We predict these outcomes based on three broad steps. In step 1, we find counterparts to the treatment- and control-group individuals in the non-experimental sample to find synthetic control and treatment groups. In step 2, we fit the dynamic relationship between the vector of outcomes at time $t$ ($\bm{Y}^{d}_{i,t}$) and predictor variables (and interactions) that are affected by treatment ($\bm{X}^{d}_{i,t}$), as well as background variables ($\bm{B}$). In step 3, we use the dynamic relationships estimated in the non-experimental synthetic control and treatment groups to predict the post-$t^{\ast}$ outcomes.

To illustrate our procedure, Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles} displays the life-cycle labor income profiles \textit{predicted} for the treatment and control groups. It also displays the proximity of the \textit{realized} labor income to the \textit{predicted} labor income at $t^*$. This pattern of life-cycle labor income is typical for low-skilled workers \citep{Blundell-etal_2015_J-Pub-E,Gladden_Taber_2000_WageProgression,Sanders-Taber_2012_AR,Lagakos_Moll_etal_2016_LifeCycle_NBER}.\footnote{The prediction of labor (transfer) income is based on indicator variables of being male and being black, mother's education, average PIAT scores from ages 5 to 7, years of education at age 30, body-mass index at 34, labor (transfer) income at ages 21 and 30, and one-period lagged labor (transfer) income. As we explain in the next section, our prediction is based on a first-order Markov process. We use labor (transfer) income at age 21 to initialize this process. The age-30 observation helps us validate our procedure. A justification for the use of these variables, evidence on their predictive power, and a sensitivity analysis to different prediction variables are in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}. In that appendix and in Section 6.3, we examine our predictions for parental income.}

We combine data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (CNLSY79). We highlight the \textit{observed} labor income at $t^*$ (age 30) for the ABC/CARE control- and treatment-group participants. Panel (b) displays the analogous figure for females. Our predictions go up to age 67, age of assumed retirement. Standard errors are based on the empirical bootstrap distribution. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology} for a discussion of our choice of predictors and a sensitivity analysis of those predictors. \textbf{[JJH: We say we are going through 79 but graphs say 60! What is going on?]
[JLG: We assume that retirement happens at age 67 (and we clarify this when presenting the predicted NPVs), but the rest of projections go beyond. But you are right. The plots were stopping at age 60. Now they go all the way to retirement.]}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

In the experimental sample, all of the parents of children with observed characteristics $\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ agree to participate in the program. \textbf{[JJH: Jorge is this really true? We start with 122 and 22 drop -- big attrition from the study.] [JLG: Yes, this is the number. It includes four children death, four children who left the study because their parents moved, and two children who were diagnosed as developmentally delayed. All details are in Table A2. But still, everyone offered the program was randomized to either treatment or control. The assumption $W = 1$ is correct, because the cases happened \textit{after} randomization. We are being clear about it, but we need to keep reinforcing it because of what we have pointed out on (i) interpretation of parameters; and (ii) the test for the predictions.]} Because the non-experimental sample has no treatment group members, we test of the validity of our prediction procedure is by comparing the labor income of individuals in the non-experimental sample for whom $\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ to the labor income of individuals in the synthetic control group (i.e., the groups in the non-experimental samples used to extrapolate control group outcomes). We also compare labor income at $t^*$ of both groups to the observed labor income at $t^*$ in the experimental control group. Figure~\ref{figure:controltests} makes these comparisons. We plot the labor income of individuals in our non-experimental sample for whom $\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_0$ and the synthetic control group from ages 20 to 45. We also display the labor income of the experimental control group at $t^*$ (age 30).\footnote{The graphs stop at age 45 because we do not observe all of the components of the risk index determinants of eligibility after age 45 in the non-experimental samples. We use only a subset of this index to make life-cycle projections. These variables are effective predictors over the age range for which the full set of $\bm{B}$ is available.}

\subsection{Creating Future Counterfactuals}\label{section:just}

We first present our analytical framework and its underlying assumptions. Outcome $j$ at time $t$ in the set of outcomes $\mathcal{J}_{t}$ is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:outcome}
Y_{j,t}^d = \phi_{j,t}^d \left( \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right) + \varepsilon_{j,t}^d,
\end{equation}
where $d$ indicates if an individual is fixed to control ($d = 0$) or treatment ($d = 1$) status. We interpret  $\phi_{j,t}^d \left( \cdot \right)$ as a production function: it maps the inputs $\bm{X}_{t}^d$ together with background variables $\bm{B}$ to the output $Y_{j,t}^d$. The $\bm{X}^d_t$ include lagged variables caused by treatment. We initially assume $\varepsilon_{j,t}^d$ is exogenous. We discuss and test possible violations of this assumption later.

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:exog} \textbf{Exogeneity in the Experimental Sample}\\
For all $t, t'' \in \{ 0, \ldots, T \}$ and for $d, d' \in \{0,1\}$,
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon^d_{j,t} \indep \bm{X}^{d^{\prime}}_{t^{''}} \mid \bm{B},
\end{equation}
for all outcomes $j \in \mathcal{J}_{t}$.
\end{assumption}

In our sample, parents of eligible children ($\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0}$), always agree to participate in the program ($W = 1$) and accept treatment ($R = D$).\footnote{It is always true that $\bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0}$ implies $W = 1$. Afterward, there are cases of attrition that could be interpreted as $R \neq D$, but this was not the case at the beginning of treatment. We distinguish attrition from non-compliance. We analyze these cases and document very little sensitivity of our estimates to them in Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc}.} Given this, we can use $D$ and $R$ interchangeably and we use a standard \citet{Quandt_1972_JASA} switching regression model:
\begin{align}
Y_{j,t}     =& \left( 1 - D \right) Y_{j,t}^0    + \left( D \right) Y_{j,t}^1 \nonumber \\
\bm{X}_{t} =& \left( 1 - D \right) \bm{X}_{t}^0 + \left( D \right) \bm{X}_{t}^1. \label{eq:countersystem}
\end{align}

The fact that $D = R$ allows us to use experimental data to compute the distribution of $Y_{j,t}^d$ (i.e., $Y_{j,t}^d$ when fixing to treatment status ($d$)).\footnote{Randomization allows us to do this, but \textit{fixing and conditioning are fundamentally different concepts}. See \citet{Heckman_Pinto_2015_EconometTheory} for a discussion.}

We provide a general framework under which we can identify $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t}^d | \bm{X}_{t}^d = \bm{x}_t^d, \bm{B} = \bm{b}  \right]$ in $t > t^*$ using non-experimental samples. We use two economically-motivated assumptions on the production function in \eqref{eq:outcome} and a set of auxiliary assumptions to identify our out-of-sample predictions. This allows us to predict long-term treatment effects. Our framework has testable implications, which we implement below.

First, we let the variables $\bm{X}_{t}$ ``fully summarize treatment.'' That is, we assume that any effect that treatment has on an outcome of interest operates through the inputs $\bm{X}_{t}$ and not through shifts in the production function. Assumption~\ref{ass:summary} formalizes this assumption.

\begin{assumption} \label{ass:summary} \textbf{$\bm{X}_{t}$ Summarizes Treatment Effects}\\
For any $\left( \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right)$,
\begin{align}
\phi_{j,t}^0 \left( \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right) &= \phi_{j,t}^1 \left( \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right) \\   \nonumber
                                                                     &=: \phi_{j,t} \left( \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right)
\end{align}
\noindent for $t \in \{ 0, \ldots, T \}$ and for any outcome $j \in \mathcal{J}_{t}$.
\end{assumption}
This allows us to write:
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t}^d | \bm{X}_{t}^d  = \bm{x}_{t}^d, \bm{B} = \bm{b}, D = d \right] &=  \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t}^d  = \bm{x}_{t}^d, \bm{B} = \bm{b}, D = d \right] \nonumber\\
&=\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t}  = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} =  \bm{b} \right], \label{eq:invariancetest}
\end{align}
where the first equality follows from combining Equation \eqref{eq:countersystem} and Assumption~\ref{ass:exog} and the second equality follows from  Assumption~\ref{ass:summary}.

Equation~\eqref{eq:invariancetest} is a statement on how to summarize the treatment effects on $Y_{j,t}^d$ based on the variables affected by treatment $\bm{X}_{t}^d$, together with the background variables $\bm{B}$. It is not a statement on how to predict $Y_{j,t}^d$ out-of-sample. It is possible to test \ref{ass:summary} within the experimental sample at $t = t^*$. The test consists of asking if $\bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B}$ summarize the treatment effects on  $Y_{j,t}^d$, and therefore an indicator of treatment take-up becomes irrelevant when computing $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t}  = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} =  \bm{b}, D = d \right]$. We test the null hypotheses associated with this assumption for the outcomes that we subsequently predict. We fail to reject the null  hypothesis that the coefficient associated with random assignment to treatment is different from zero conditioning on $\bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B}$.\footnote{This holds when pooling males and females and when testing by gender (see Appendix~\ref{app:invariance}).}

Second, we provide conditions under which we can use non-experimental samples to predict $Y_{j,t}^d$ out of the experimental sample. First, we write outcome $j$ at time $t$ in the set of outcomes $\mathcal{J}_{t}$ in the non-experimental sample as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:outcomenonexp}
Y_{j,t} = \widetilde{\phi}_{j,t} \left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right) + \varepsilon_{j,t}
\end{equation}
and assume that an assumption analogous to Assumption~\ref{ass:exog} holds in the non-experimental sample:

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:exogne} \textbf{Exogeneity in the Non-experimental Sample}\\
For all $t, t'' \in \{ 0, \ldots, T \}$,
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{j,t} \indep \bm{X}_{t^{''}},
\end{equation}
\noindent for all outcomes $j \in \mathcal{J}_{t}$.
\end{assumption}

Under Assumptions~\ref{ass:exog} and \ref{ass:exogne}, a prediction of $Y_{j,t}$ for the experimental sample based on \eqref{eq:outcomenonexp} is valid under an structural invariance assumption. That is, \eqref{eq:outcomenonexp} is valid under the assumption that the dynamic economic relationships in \eqref{eq:outcome} and \eqref{eq:outcomenonexp} are structurally invariant to cohort or any other potential shifters of the economic relationships between $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ and $Y_{t,j}$. Formally,

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:invariance} \textbf{Structural Invariance} \\

\phi_{j,t} \left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right) = \widetilde{\phi}_{j,t} \left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right).
\end{equation}
for $t \in \{ 0, \ldots, T \}$ and for any outcome $j \in \mathcal{J}_{t}$.\footnote{Assumptions~\ref{ass:summary} and \ref{ass:invariance} appeal to a fundamental property of invariant economic relationships used by economists since the time of \citet{Frisch_1938_autonomy}. Frisch called this notion ``autonomy.'' Much later work in statistics captures structural invariance as one aspect of ``SUTVA.'' See \citet{Holland_1986_JASA} and \citet{Heckman_2008_ISR}.}

Let $S$ indicate whether an observation belongs the experimental sample ($S = 1$) or to the non-experimental sample ($S = 0$). Combining Assumptions~\ref{ass:exogne} and \ref{ass:invariance} we obtain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:withbetimplication}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t} = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B}, S = s \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t} = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} \right].
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:withbetimplication} is an implication that we can test at $t \leq t^*$, when we observe $Y_{j,t}$ in both the experimental and non-experimental samples. The test is very similar to the test of Assumption~\ref{ass:summary}. We assess if the null hypothesis that the coefficient associated with $S$ is equal to zero when computing $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t} = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} = \bm{b}, S = s \right]$ pooling the experimental (treatment and control groups) and the non-experimental samples. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient associated with $S$ is different from zero conditioning on $\bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B}$.\footnote{This holds when pooling males and females and when testing by gender (see Appendix~\ref{app:invariance}).}

Assumption~\ref{ass:invariance} is a statement on the dynamic relationship between $Y_{j,t}$ and $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ in the experimental and non-experimental samples. We can refine it further so that it is satisfied for certain values of $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ in the non-experimental samples. Put differently, we can construct synthetic control and treatment groups in the non-experimental samples by matching the experimental and non-experimental samples based on $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ at $t \leq t^*$. Then, we can fit the dynamic relationship $\phi_{j,t} \left( \cdot \right)$ with which we predict out-of-sample based on these synthetic control and treatment groups.

Algorithm~\ref{alg:match} formalizes the construction of the synthetic treatment and control groups, following, e.g., \citet{Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1998_REStud}.

\onehalfspacing
\begin{algorithm}\label{alg:match}\textbf{Matching Experimental to Non-experimental Sample Individuals}
For individual $i$ in the experimental treatment or control groups, an individual $j(i)$ is a treatment or control counterpart in the non- experimental sample if

\sqrt{\left( \bm{X}^{d}_{i,t} - \bm{X}_{j(i),t} \right)^{\prime} {\left( \bm{\Sigma}^d\right)}^{-1} \left(\bm{X}^{d}_{i,t} - \bm{X}_{j(i),t} \right)} < \epsilon \text{ for } \quad d \in \ \{0,1\}, \ \ t \in \{0,\dots,T\}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is arbitrarily small.\footnote{In practice, we set $\epsilon = 1$, but we try a range of values between 0.5 and 3 finding little sensitivity. The full set of the results we produce in the paper for multiple values in the interval [0.5,3] is available under request.} $j(i) \in F_0$, for $t \leq t^{\ast}$, where $F_0$ is the index set in the auxiliary sample and $\bm{\Sigma}^d$ is the covariance matrix of $\bm{X}$ in the experimental sample group $d$.\footnote{In practice, the variables in $\bm{X}^{d}_{i,t}$ that we use to find the control- and treatment-group counterparts according to \eqref{eq:ingrownnail} and the variables that we use to fit the dynamic relationships differ. We do so because the available variables across different non-experimental samples differ---recall that we use different non-experimental samples at different stages of the life cycle given data restrictions. We construct the matches using a common set of variables, and then exploit information on additional variables when predicting at different stages of the life cycle. We present sensitivity to using different variables to find control- and treatment-group counterparts in Appendix~\ref{appendix:match} and sensitivity using different variables to fit the dynamic relationships in Appendix~\ref{appendix:senspredict}.} If the inequality in \eqref{eq:ingrownnail} does not hold, we assign to individual $j(i)$ a weight of 0. If it holds, we weigh the individual with the inverse value of the left-hand side of \eqref{eq:ingrownnail}.

\textbf{[JJH: Jorge, this is really just a detail.] [JLG: I agree. Let me know if you want me to move this to the part of the Appendix in which we describe the non-experimental samples. We can then in the main paper simply say that we construct certain matched samples using this algorithm. But I agree this is a detail.]}

Matching the experimental and non-experimental samples to construct a prediction and constructing the prediction are fundamentally different. The former uses the sample in which we fit the dynamics relationships to calculate our predictions, while the latter constructs the prediction itself. Arguably, fitting the dynamic relationships of interest in a sample constructed according to Algorithm~\ref{alg:match} makes Assumption~\ref{ass:invariance} more plausible. We identify the dynamic relationships using individuals in the non-experimental who are similar along observed characteristics at $t \leq t^*$.

Finally, Assumption~\ref{ass:contain} guarantees that the dynamic relationship in the non-experimental sample is valid for any value of $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ in the experimental sample.\footnote{Is is straightforward to test this assumption. We provide evidence favoring it in Appendix~\ref{app:containsupport}.}

\begin{equation}
\sup( \bm{Y}_{t}, \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} )^{s=1} \subseteq \sup( \bm{Y}_{t}, \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} )^{s=0}.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:main} \textbf{Consistent Out-of-Sample Predictions} \\
Let Assumptions~\ref{ass:exog},~\ref{ass:summary}, \ref{ass:exogne} hold and let Assumption~\ref{ass:invariance} hold for the experimental and the synthetic control and treatment groups constructed from the non-experimental sample according to Algorithm~\ref{alg:match}. Then, for any value of $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$, $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t} = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} = \bm{b}, S = 0 \right]$ is a consistent out-of-sample prediction of $Y_{j,t}^d$ for $d \in \{ 0, 1\}$, for all $j \in \mathcal{J}_{t}$ and for any $t \geq t^* \in \{t^*, \ldots, T \}$. $\Box$

We need to show that
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t} | \bm{X}_{t} = \bm{x}_{t}, \bm{B} = \bm{b}, S = 0 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j,t}^d | \bm{X}_{t}^d = \bm{x}_t^d, \bm{B} = \bm{b}  \right].
\end{equation}
The equality follows from the arguments above for which Equation~\eqref{eq:invariancetest} and Equation~\eqref{eq:withbetimplication} hold.

\doublespacing

To summarize, Theorem~\ref{theorem:main} states that when the dynamic relationship between $Y_{j,t}$ and $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ satisfies invariance properties (i) to the ABC/CARE experiment; and (ii) to the sample to which the relationship is fitted, and exogeneity and common support conditions are satisfied, we are able to obtain consistent out-of-sample predictions.\footnote{Adding our method to account for attrition to the theorem is straightforward. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:attrition}.}

\subsubsection{Accounting for Endogeneity}\label{section:accendog}

We provide evidence favoring Assumptions~\ref{ass:summary}, \ref{ass:invariance}, and \ref{ass:contain} in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}. Assumptions~\ref{ass:exog} and ~\ref{ass:exogne} could also be violated. We explain why is it the case next, and provide tests for these two assumptions.

We match individuals in the control and treatment groups to individuals in the non-experimental samples based on \textit{observed characteristics}. In general, the dependence between $\bm{X}_{t}$ and $\bm{\varepsilon}_{t}$ is not the same across those two samples. Assumptions~\ref{ass:exog} and ~\ref{ass:exogne} could be violated in the experimental sample, the non-experimental sample, or both samples. These violations could occur, for example, when there are unmeasured inputs generated by the experiment.

Unless the biases in the predictions for both the treatment and control groups are exactly the same, the predicted treatment effect resulting from our predictions is not consistent. If prediction equations are separable in unobservables, a sufficient condition to obtain unbiased predictions is to assume that $\mathbb{E} \left[ \varepsilon_{j,t}^0 | \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ \varepsilon_{j,t}^1 | \bm{X}_{t}^d, \bm{B} \right]$.

To investigate the relevance of endogeneity, we follow \citet{Heckman_Pinto_etal_2013_PerryFactor} and assume that, in the experimental sample, $\varepsilon_{j,t}^d$ obeys a factor structure with an associated set of measures $\bm{M}_{t}^d$. Formally, let the system be
\begin{align}\label{eq:sa-msystemmain}
\bm{M}_{t}^d &= \bm{\lambda}^d \bm{\theta}_{t}^d +  \bm{\upsilon}_t^d   \nonumber \\
\varepsilon_{t}^d &=\bm{\beta}^d \bm{\theta}_{t}^d + \bm{\omega}_{t}^d,
\end{align}
where $\bm{\theta}^d  \independent \bm{\upsilon}_{t}^d,  \bm{\omega}_{t}^d$ and $\bm{\upsilon_{t}^d} \independent \bm{\omega_{t}^d}$ for all $t \in \{0, \ldots, T \}$.

With an auxiliary system of measures $\bm{M}_{t}^d $ consisting of at least three measures, we are able to identify the vectors of coefficients characterizing this system, $\bm{\lambda}^d, \bm{\beta}^d$, as well as the respective covariance matrices, $\Sigma_{\bm{\theta}_{t}^d}, \Sigma_{\bm{\upsilon}_{t}^d}, \Sigma_{\bm{\omega}_{t}^d}$, use the method in \citet{Bartlett_1938_Nature} to obtain an estimate of $\bm{\theta}_{t}^d$ \citep{Cunha_Heckman_ea_2005_oep,Cunha_Heckman_etal_2010_est_tech_cognoncog}, and use it as a control function when testing the validity of Assumption~\ref{ass:summary}, i.e. use it to ``control'' for endogeneity. An analogous system in the non-experimental sample allows us to test Assumption~\ref{ass:invariance} and to assess the relevance of endogeneity when constructing our predictions.

To implement this, we assume that $\bm{\theta}_{t}^d$ has two dimensions (one representing cognitive skill, $c$, and another representing non-cognitive skill, $n$). We assume dedicated measures for these skills at one time period. Put simply, we have two independent systems, one to measure $\bm{\theta}_{c}^d$ and one to measure $\bm{\theta}_{n}^d$, where $\bm{\theta}_{t}^d: = \left[ \bm{\theta}_{c}^d, \bm{\theta}_{n}^d \right]$. Further, we assume a common measurement system for the treatment and control groups (this is a sensible assumption given the small size of our sample). This assumption implies that $\bm{\lambda}^d, \bm{\beta}^d$, as well as $\bm{\Sigma}_{\bm{\theta}_{t}^d}, \bm{\Sigma}_{\bm{\upsilon}_{t}^d}$ are the same either when $d = 0$ or when $d = 1$.

We use a set of IQ measures from ages 2 to 8 to obtain an estimate of $\bm{\theta}_{c}^d$ and a set of measures of somatization, hostility, depression, and mental health all at age 21 to measure to estimate $\bm{\theta}_{n}^d$.\footnote{For definitions and treatment effects on these variables see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}.} Figure~\ref{figure:factorsm} shows our estimates by treatment status.

Both measures of skills are standardized to a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. ``Less'' in the factor measuring non-cognitive skills is ``positive'' given the measures we rely on to construct it. The mean difference between treatment and control is displayed below each panel, with standard error in parentheses. Standard errors are based on the empirical bootstrap distribution.
\end{figure}

Our tests of Assumption~\ref{ass:summary} display little sensitivity to controlling for $\bm{\theta}_{t}^d$. When constructing a system analogous to \eqref{eq:sa-msystemmain} in the non-experimental sample to account for endogeneity, we also find little sensitivity to accounting for endogeneity when testing Assumption~\ref{ass:invariance} and when constructing predictions. These tests indicate that  $\left( \bm{X}_{t}, \bm{B} \right)$ are adequate measured inputs for the output $Y_{j,t}$ and that endogeneity is not a first order concern for our predictions (see Appendix~\ref{app:invariance} and Appendix~\ref{app:endogeneity}).

\subsection{Parental Income} \label{section:pincome}

In practice, ABC/CARE had a childcare component: childcare to the parents of treated children was offered at the center for more than nine hours a day for five years. Recall that only $27\%$ of mothers of children reported to live with a partner at baseline and this status barely changed during the experiment (See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}). Arguably, this is the component that generates the treatment effects in maternal education, labor force participation, and parental income reported in Table~\ref{table:tescombined} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}.

We observe parental income at eight different years from when the experimental subjects were born until they were 21.\footnote{The ages at which parental income is observed is at ages 0, 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 8, 12, 15, and 21. At age 21 the mothers in ABC/CARE were, on average, 41 years old.} Our baseline estimation considers the treatment effect on parental income without going beyond this age. We linearly interpolate the ages for which we do not have observations between 0 and 21.\footnote{Depending on the model of labor supply, labor income should or should not include the value of forgone leisure. We conduct a sensitivity analysis below by considering the case when markets are assumed to be clearing and the marginal value of leisure is the market wage.} As Table~\ref{table:tescombined} shows, treatment effects on parental income are sustained through child's age 21. This is presumably due to wage growth (higher education and/or more experience). An ideal approach considers the profile over the full life cycle of mothers. We propose two alternative approaches for doing this in Appendix~\ref{app:parentalincome}: (i) an approach based on parameterizing parental labor income using standard Mincer equations; and (ii) an approach based on the model of Section~\ref{section:just}. We present estimates using the baseline approach and for these two alternatives in Section~\ref{section:cbaresults}. The benefits of the program increase when considering the full life cycle of mothers, using either approach.

If it is true that ABC/CARE had a childcare component inducing benefits on parental labor market outcomes, it is likely the case that it benefits parents who, at baseline, did not have any other children. If they did, then they might have had to take care of other children anyway, weakening the childcare-driven effect (especially if there are younger siblings present). Figure~\ref{figure:pincome} shows that the net increase (treatment minus control) in discounted parental income is much higher in the absence of siblings (of the participant children) at baseline. The effect also weakens when comparing children who have siblings younger than 5 years old to children who have siblings 5 years old or younger.\footnote{These patterns persist when splitting the ABC/CARE sample by gender, but the estimates are not precise because the samples become too small.}

Panel (b) drops children without siblings at baseline. Parental income is in 2014 USD discounted to child's participant age 0 using a 3\% rate. We use the baseline measure of parental income in Section~\ref{section:pincome}. Results using our alternative parental income measures are similar (see Appendix~\ref{app:parentalincome}).

\subsection{Health} \label{section:health}

 We predict and monetize health outcomes based on a version of Equation~\eqref{eq:outcome} with a full vector of lagged dependent variables. This requires adapting the the models of Section~\ref{section:just}. Three additional issues arise: (i) health outcomes such as diabetes or heart disease are absorbing states; (ii) health outcomes are highly interdependent within and across time periods; and (iii) there is no obvious terminal time period for benefits and costs except death, which is endogenous.\footnote{For example, for income we extrapolate up to the retirement age of 67. However, for health, we need to predict an age of death for each individual.} Our auxiliary model for health is an adaptation of the Future America Model (FAM). This model predicts health outcomes from the subjects' mid-30s up to their projected death \citep{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-Elderly-Model-Report}.\footnote{The simulation starts at the age in which we observe the subject's age-30 follow-up.} Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} discusses the FAM methodology in detail. We initialize the health prediction using the same variables that we use when predicting labor and transfer income, along with the initial health conditions as listed in Table~\ref{table:transition}.

The methodology has five steps: (i) estimate age-by-age health state transition probabilities using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); (ii) match these transition probabilities to the ABC/CARE subjects based on observed characteristics; (iii) estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) models using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the PSID; (iv) estimate medical cost models using the MEPS and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), allowing estimates to differ by health state and observed characteristics; and (v) predict the medical expenditure and QALYs that correspond to the simulated individual health trajectories.\footnote{As an intermediate step between (i) and (ii), we impute some of the variables used to initialize the FAM models (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:health}).}

Our microsimulation model starts the health predictions at age 30, with the information on observed characteristics available at this age. Restricting it to the individuals for whom we have information from the age-34 health follow-up allows us to account for components that are important for predicting health outcomes. The models predict the probability of being in any of the states in the horizontal axis of Table~\ref{table:transition} at age $a+1$ based on the state at age $a$, which is described by the vertical axis of the table.\footnote{In practice, the predictions are based on two-year lags, due to data limitations in the auxiliary sources we use to simulate the FAM. For example, if the individual is 30 (31) years old in the age-30 interview, we simulate the trajectory of her health status at ages 30 (31), 32 (33), 34 (35), and so on until her projected death.} Absorbing states are an exception. For example, heart disease at age $a$ does not enter in the estimation of transitions for heart disease at age $a+1$ because it is an absorbing state: once a person has heart disease, she carries it through the rest of her life.

\begin{sidewaystable}[!htbp]

The age $a$ states that do not predict themselves at age $a+1$ are absorbing states by construction.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{sidewaystable}

At each age, once we obtain the transition probability for each health outcome, we make a Monte-Carlo draw for each subject. Thus, each simulation depends on each individual's health history and on their particular characteristics. For every simulated trajectory of health outcomes, we predict the lifetime medical expenditure using the models estimated from the MEPS and the MCBS. We then obtain an estimate of the expected lifetime medical expenditure by taking the mean of each individual's simulated lifetime medical expenditure.

The same procedure is applied to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\footnote{A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) reweighs a year of life according to its quality given the burden of disease. Suppose we assign a value of $\$150,000$ (2014 USD) to each year of life. A QALY of $\$150,000$ denotes a year of life in the absence of disease (perfect health). The value of QALY for an individual in a given year is smaller than $\$150,000$ when there is positive burden of disease, as worse health conditions imply lower QALYs. When an individual dies, her QALY equals zero. There are extreme combinations of disease and disability that may generate negative QALYs, although this case is unusual.} We compute a QALY model based on a widely-used health-related Quality-of-life (HRQoL) measure (EQ-5D), available in MEPS.\footnote{For a definition and explanation of this instrument, see \citet{Dolan_1997_Modeling_MC,Shaw_etal_2005_EQ5D_MC}.} We then estimate this model using the PSID.

We estimate three models of medical spending: (i) Medicare spending (annual medical spending paid by parts A, B, and D of Medicare); (ii) out-of-pocket spending (medical spending paid directly by the individual); and (ii) all public spending other than Medicare. Each medical spending model includes the variables we use to predict labor and transfer income, together with current health, risk factors, and functional status as explanatory variables.

We also calculate medical expenditure before age 30. The ABC/CARE interviews at ages 12, 15, 21 and 30 have information related to hospitalizations at different ages and number of births before age 30. We combine this retrospective information and individual and family demographic variables with medical spending models estimates using MEPS to predict medical spending for each age.

QALYs are crucial to our estimations because they monetize the health of an individual at each age. Figure~\ref{fig:qalys} shows our estimation of QALYs together with a PSID comparison, in an exercise analogous to that used to produce Figure~\ref{fig:labor-income-profiles}.\footnote{In our baseline estimation, we assume that each year of life is worth  $\$150,000$ (2014 USD). Our estimates are robust to substantial variation in this assumption, as we show in Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity}.} Although there is not a clear age-by-age treatment effect on QALYs, there is a significant difference in the accumulated present value of the QALYs between the treatment and the control groups. The QALYs for individuals in the control group match the QALYs of disadvantaged individuals in the PSID.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} we further discuss and justify the parameterizations required to obtain estimates of QALYs. \citet{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-America-Model} examine the sensitivity to these parameterizations and discuss alternative micro-simulations monetizing health condition.}

\subsection{Crime}  \label{sec:crime}

To estimate the life-cycle benefits and costs of ABC/CARE related to criminal activity, we use rich data on crime outcomes obtained from public police records.\footnote{Two previous studies consider the impacts of ABC on crime: \citet{Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ} use administrative crime records up to age 21, and find no significant differences between the treatment and the control groups. \cite{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} account for self-reported crime at age 21. They find little effects, but the lack longer term, administrative data.} See Appendix \ref{appendix:crime} for a more complete explanation of the following procedures. We consider the following types of crime: arson, assault, burglary, fraud, larceny, miscellaneous (which includes traffic and non-violent drug crimes), murder, vehicle theft, rape, robbery, and vandalism. We use administrative data that detail: (i) youth arrests, gathered at the age-21 follow-up; (ii) adult arrests, gathered at the age-34 follow-up; and (iii) sentences, gathered at the age-34 follow-up. We also use self-reported data on adult crimes, gathered in the age-21 and age-30 subject interviews. Because none of these sources capture all criminal activity, it is necessary to combine them to more completely approximate the crimes the subjects committed. We also use several auxiliary datasets to complete the life-cycle profile of criminal activity and compute the costs of the committed crimes.

We follow four steps to estimate the costs of crime.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Count arrests and sentences.} We start by counting the total number of sentences for each individual and type of crime (arson, assault, etc.) up to age 34, matching crimes across data sources, to construct the total number of  arrests for each individual and type of crime up to age 34.\footnote{In practice, we count all offenses (an arrest might include multiple offenses). This gives the correct number of victims for our estimations. The youth data have coarser categories than the rest of the data: violent, property, drug, and other. To match these data with the adult data, we assume that all property crimes were larcenies and that all violent crimes are assaults. In the ABC/CARE sample, assault is the most common type of violent crime, and larceny/theft is the most common property crime.} For individuals missing arrest data,\footnote{About 10\% of the ABC/CARE sample has missing arrest data. We fail to reject differences in observed characteristics between the treatment- and control-group participants for whom we observe arrests data (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}).} we impute the number of arrests by multiplying the number of sentences for each type of crime by a national arrest-sentence ratio for the respective crime.\footnote{This arrest-sentence ratio is constructed using the National Crime Victimization Survey (NJRP) and the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics (UCRS).}

\item \textit{Construct predictions.} Based on the sentences observed before age 34, we predict the sentences that the ABC/CARE subjects will have after age 34. Data from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (NCDPS), which provide lifetime sentences of individuals in North Carolina, are used to estimate sentences incurred after age 34 from sentences incurred before age 34. Applying these models to the ABC/CARE data, we predict the number of future sentences for each subject up to age 50.\footnote{We assume that individuals with no criminal records before age 34 commit no crimes after age 34.} We then add these estimates to the original number of sentences, getting an estimate of the lifetime sentences. Adding these estimates increases the total count of crimes by 30\%--50\%.

\item \textit{Estimate number of victims from the crimes.} We only observe crimes that resulted in consequences in the justice system: crimes that resulted in arrests and/or sentences. To include unobserved crimes, we use victimization inflation (VI).\footnote{Previous papers using this method include \citet{Belfield_Nores_etal_2006_JHR} and \cite{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}.} We start by constructing a VI ratio, which is the national ratio of victims and arrests for each type of crime.\footnote{We assume that each crime with victims is counted separately in the national reports on arrests, even for arrests that might have been motivated by more than one crime. This victim-arrest ratio is constructed using the NJRP and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).} Then, we estimate the number of victims from the crimes committed by ABC/CARE subjects as their total arrests multiplied by the VI ratio.\footnote{Additionally, we can calculate an analogous estimate of the number of crime victims using sentences, based on the VI ratio and the national arrests-to-sentences ratio. Both estimates are very similar, as shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}. To improve precision, the estimates in the rest of our paper are based on the average of the two calculations.}

\item \textit{Find total costs of crimes.} We use the estimates of the cost of crimes for victims from \cite{McCollister_etal_2010_DAD} to impute the total victimization costs. For crimes resulting in arrests and/or sentences, we consider justice system costs as well, such as police costs.\footnote{To be able to assign costs to each type of crime, we assume that the cost of the justice system depends on the number of offenses of each type, rather than on the number of arrests. While this could very slightly overestimate justice system costs, the costs only represent about 5\% of the total crime costs.} Finally, we construct the total costs of incarceration for each subject using the total prison time and the cost of a day in prison.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity} examines the sensitivity of our crime costs quantification to different assumptions. Section~\ref{section:cbaresults} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity} we examine the sensitivity of our overall assessment of ABC/CARE results to the quantification of crime that we explain in this section.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Education}

Follow-up data on educational attainment were collected up to age 30. In Appendix \ref{appendix:education}, we show that using auxiliary data sources, education up to this age is an accurate predictor of lifetime educational attainment. Therefore, we do not predict beyond age 30. To monetize the costs of education, we consider the public costs of K-12 education and the private costs of post-secondary education, including vocational programs and community college. Other costs of education include grade retention and special education.

Previous analyses of ABC pay special attention to special education, arguing that savings due to a reduction in this category are substantial \citep{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER}.\footnote{This analyses does not include CARE.} This category is much less important in our calculation; pooling males and females the net gain due to a reduction in special education is $\$3,633.3$ (2014 USD) (s.e. $703.7)$.\footnote{This quantity is not discounted for comparability with other analyses. For males the gain is $\$13,417.9$ (2014 USD) (s.e. $1,061.0$) and for females there is actually a loss of $6,276.5$ (2014 USD) (s.e. $\$1,018.5$).}

\section{Benefit/Cost Analysis} \label{section:cbaresults}

This section reports cost/benefit and rate of return analyses underlying Figure~\ref{figure:main}. The results we discuss are the central focus of this paper. Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity} displays an intensive sensitivity analysis of each of the components we consider in our main results. It includes scenarios in which all our assumptions hold and scenarios in which they are drastically violated, providing bounds for our estimates. It is an extension of the sensitivity analysis presented in Table~\ref{table:cba}.

\subsection{Program Costs} \label{section:programscosts}

The yearly cost of the program was \$18,514 per participant in 2014 USD. We improve on previous cost estimates using primary-source documents.\footnote{Our calculations are based on progress reports written by the principal investigators and related documentation recovered in the archives of the research center where the program was implemented. We display these sources in Appendix \ref{app:programcosts}. The main component is related to staff costs. Other costs arise from nutrition and services that the subjects received when they were sick, diapers during the first 15 months of their lives, and transportation to the center. The control-group children also received diapers during approximately 15 months, and iron-fortified formula. The costs are based on sources describing ABC treatment for $52$ children. We use the same costs estimates for CARE, for which information is less available. The costs exclude any expenses related to research or policy analysis. Our calculation of the costs per year in 1979 USD is $\$295,239$. A separate calculation of the program as implemented indicates that the yearly cost of the program was $\$275,475$ (1979 USD). See Appendix \ref{app:programcosts}.}

\subsection{Benefit/Cost Estimates}

Table~\ref{table:bcsens} presents our baseline estimates of benefit/cost ratios, Table~\ref{table:irrsens} presents the analogous internal rates of return. Pooling males and females, the results indicate that the program is socially efficient: the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are $12.6\%$ and $5.6$. \textit{The program generates a benefit of \bcp\ for every dollar spent on it}. They are statistically significant, even after accounting for sampling variation, serial correlation, and prediction error in the experimental and non-experimental samples and the tax costs of financing the program. These results are important because ABC/CARE was much more expensive than other early childhood education programs---the treatment involved more services over a longer time period \citep{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}.

We accompany these estimates with a set of sensitivity checks of statistical and economic interest. Our estimates are not driven by our methods for accounting for attrition and item non-response or by the conditioing variables we use when computing the net-present values (specification columns).  Although the internal rate of return remains relatively high when using participant outcome measures up to ages 21 or 30, the benefit/cost ratios indicate that accounting for benefits that go beyond age 30 is relevant. The return to each dollar is at most $3/1$ when considering benefits up to age 30 only (prediction span columns). The counterfactuals considered also make a difference. Males benefit the most from ABC/CARE relative to alternative preschools, while females benefit the most from ABC/CARE relative to staying at home. We further explore this difference below.

Our baseline estimates account for the deadweight caused by the government by taxing individuals to budget its expenditure for all government-related activities.\footnote{When the transaction between the government and an individual is a direct transfer, we consider .5 as a cost per each transacted dollar as we do not weight the final recipient of the transaction (e.g., transfer income). When the transaction is indirect, we classify it as government spending as a whole and consider its cost as 1.5 per each dollar spend (e.g. public education).} Our baseline estimate assumes that the marginal tax rate is $50\%$. Our estimates are robust to dropping it to $0\%$ or doubling it to $100\%$ (deadweight loss columns). Our baseline estimation of benefit/cost ratios is based on a discount rate of $3\%$. Not discounting roughly doubles our benefit/cost ratios, while they remain significant under a higher discount rate of $7\%$ (discount rate columns).

Parental income is an important component of the benefit/cost ratio. We take a conservative approach in our baseline estimates and do not account for the potential profile shift in parental income due to education and experience (see Section~\ref{section:pincome}). This is based on observed parental income from when the ABC/CARE participants where ages 0 to 21.

Alternative approaches considering the gain up to when the parent is 65 years old generate an increase in the gain due to parental income (parental income columns). As we mention in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology}, our estimates ignore any cohort effects. Individuals in ABC/CARE could experience positive cohort effects that might (i) make them more productive and therefore experience wage growth \citep{Lagakos_Moll_etal_2016_LifeCycle_NBER}; (ii) experience a negative shock such as an economic crisis and therefore experience wage decline \citep{Jarosch_2016_JobSecurity_Econometrica}. Our estimates are robust when we vary annual growth and decay rates between $-.5\%$ to $.5\%$.

We do not perform sensitivity analysis to investigate cohort effects of health costs. Treatment individuals are healthier, which reduces medical costs, but also that they live longer, increasing medical costs. These opposing effects negate each other. We have little guidance for predicting the future health costs and benefits of our cohort compared to the cohorts on which FAM is based.

We also examine the sensitivity to (i) dropping the most costly crimes as murders and rapes;\footnote{Two individuals in the treatment group committed a rape and one individual in the control group committed a murder.} and (ii) halving the costs of victimization and judiciary costs related to crime.  The first is important because we would not want our calculation to be based on a few exceptional crimes. The second is important because victimization costs are somewhat subjective (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:crime}). Our benefit/cost analysis is robust to these adjustments, even when crime is a major component. Lastly, we examine the sensitivity with respect to our main health component: quality-adjusted life years. This is an important component because relatively healthier individuals survive longer and healthier, and treatment improves health conditions. It is important to note that this component largely accumulates later in life and therefore it is heavily discounted. Dropping the component or doubling the value of life does not have a major impact in our calculations.

The estimates are robust when we conduct a drastic sensitivity analysis by removing components of the benefit/cost analysis entirely (Table~\ref{table:cba}).\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:sensitivity}, we present exercises that are not as drastic as removing the whole component, but instead removing fractions of it.} Even when completely removing the gain associated with crime for males, the program is socially efficient. Both the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are substantial. Parental income and crime are the components for which the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are the most sensitive. The reason for the sensitivity to parental income is that the amount is substantial and it is not heavily discounted because it accumulates during the first $21$ years of the children's life. Crime occurs later in life and its benefits are discounted accordingly. The amount due to crime savings is large so removing it diminishes both the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio (but they remain statistically significant).

\textit{Our sensitivity analyses indicate that it is not a single category of outcomes that drives the social efficiency of the program; it is the life-cycle benefits across various dimensions of human development.}

\subsection{Possible Explanations for Gender Differences}

The benefit/cost ratio and internal rate of return calculations both indicate that males and females benefit \emph{differently} from the program compared to the alternatives ``H'' and ``C''. There are two complementary stories that explain this difference. First, we explore reasons why the differences could exist if we focus on the outcomes we are monetizing, and not on the counterfactual we are studying. Males have relatively high benefits from outcomes that we are able to monetize: labor income and crime are two examples of this. Historically, females are less likely to supply labor than males \citep{Jaumotte_2003_OECD}. While all males supply labor in our sample at age 30, not all females supply labor. We are not able to quantify household production benefits to the treated males and females. This is an important omission for females who decide to stay at home instead of working.\footnote{The issue of females labor supply being fundamentally different from males labor supply has been noted in the Economics literature for a long time and it has posed methodological challenges (see \citet{Killingsworth_Heckman_1986_FemaleLaborSupply} for a first survey of the issues in modern Econometrics). Not being able to monetize household production is a well-known and discussed issue as well \citep{Becker_1995_Housework_Bloomberg}.}

Evidence shows that males are much more likely to commit crimes that are more costly to the victims and to the judiciary system \citep{Cohen-Bowles_2010_Estimating-Cost-Crime,Gregg_etal_2015_SocialRealities_BOOK}. It is not the case that ABC/CARE does not have treatment effects on crime for females. Actually, there are effects on a number of categories (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}). However, males commit crimes that are much more expensive. These two categories are examples of why the magnitudes of the gains are much higher for males than they are for females.

For health, the gender differences are substantial as well. But both males and females have substantial gains: males on more standard measures of physical health, while females on a set of mental health measures (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results}). We quantify both of these components (see Section~\ref{section:health} and Appendix~\ref{appendix:health}).

When analyzing different counterfactuals, there is a substantial difference between males and females. The difference is driven by one of the counterfactuals: treatment vs. alternative preschools. The estimates for both males and females generate a similar estimated ABC/CARE treatment effect compared to staying at home. Males benefit much more than treatment relative to alternative preschools than what they benefit of treatment relative to staying at home. This result is consistent with three sets of findings noted elsewhere: (i) stark gender differences resulting from attending low quality childcare \citep{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects,Baker_Gruber_Milligan_2015_Noncog_Defects}; (ii) females being less sensitive to uncertain environments \citep{Autor-etal_2015_Family-Disadvantage} and (iii) maternal absence being more deleterious for males \citep{Rutter_1972_Maternal-Deprivation}.

Our evidence does not indicate that the program has no benefit for females; in fact it does. When compared to staying at home, the gain for females indicates that there is a gain of $4.81$ dollars per each dollar invested. In fact, when we decompose the net-present value for each of the components that we monetize, we see substantial benefits for females across various categories. Health and crime included. For males, the magnitudes are noticeably reinforced when comparing treatment to alternative preschool (see Figures ~\ref{figure:npvsf} and \ref{figure:npvsm}).

\subsection{Using our Estimates to Understand Recent Benefit/Cost Analyses}

We use our analysis to examine the empirical foundations of the approach to benefit/cost analysis taken by a prototypical study of \citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}. They use data on the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) and report a benefit/cost ratio between $1.50$ and $1.84$.\footnote{HSIS is a one-year-long randomized evaluation of Head Start.} Their analysis proceeds in three steps: (i) calculate the treatment effect on IQ around age 4.5 and 5\footnote{An index based on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary and Woodcock Johnson III Tests.}; (ii) monetize this gain using the return to the IQ measured between ages 5 and 7 in terms of net present value of labor income at age 27 \citep{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}.\footnote{\citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} return is based on Stanford Achievement Tests.}$^,$\footnote{For this comparison exercise, we interpret the earnings estimated in \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} to be equivalent to labor income.} Calculations from \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} indicate that a 1 standard deviation gain in IQ at age 5 implies a $13.1\%$ increase in the net present value of labor income through age 27;\footnote{This is based on combining information from Project Star and administrative data at age 27.} and (iii) calculate the benefit/cost ratio based on this gain and their own calculations of the program's cost.\footnote{Their calculation assigns the net present value of labor income through age 27 of $\$385,907.17$ to the control-group participants, as estimated by  \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}.}$^,$\footnote{All money values that we provide in this section are in 2014 USD. We discount the value provided by \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE} to the age of birth of the children in our sample (first cohort).}

To analyze how our estimates compare to those based on the method in \citet{Kline_Walters_2016_QJE}, we display a series of exercises in the fourth column of Table~\ref{table:comparing}. For purposes of comparison, the fifth column of Table~\ref{table:comparing} shows the analogous estimates based on our own method.

In the first exercise, we use both the ``return to IQ'' and the net-present value of labor income at age 27 reported in  \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2011_QJoE}. In the second exercise, we perform a similar exercise but we use our own estimate of the net-present value of labor income at age 27.\footnote{This allows us to compute our own ``return to WPPSI'' and impute it to the treatment-group individuals.} The remaining exercises are similar, but (i) increase the age range over which we calculate the net-present value of labor income; or (ii) consider the value of all the lifetime components we analyze throughout the paper.

Our methodology provides a more accurate estimate of the net-present value (and the return to IQ) of the components. We better quantify the effects of the analyzed experiment by considering the whole life-cycle; we also better approximate the statistical uncertainty of our estimates by considering both the sampling error in the experimental and non-experimental samples and the prediction error due to the interpolation and extrapolation. Proceeding in this fashion enables us to an extensive sensitivity analysis of each of the components we monetize.

\section{Summary} \label{section:conclusion}

This paper studies two influential early childhood programs evaluated by the method of randomized control trials with long term follow up through age 34. These programs are emulated in a variety of active early childhood programs around the world. We document outcomes across multiple life domains. We find an aggregate benefit/cost ratio of 5.6 and a rate of return of 13\% per annum, even after adjusting for welfare costs of financing the program through public revenue.

To reach these conclusions, we confront and address a number of empirical challenges: (a) control group substitution; (b) extrapolating lifetime benefits beyond the experimental period; and (c) multiple hypothesis testing. Our approach serves as a template for economic evaluations of programs with partial follow up over the life cycle.

We find that benefits differ substantially by gender. Females have more beneficial treatment effects than males, but the monetized value of the male treatment effects is greater. There are substantial effects on health and (health-related) quality of life and on crime for males. For females, the benefits are concentrated on education, employment, and minor crimes. The effects for females are stronger compared to staying at home. The effects for males are stronger compared to participation in alternative preschools. The program subsidizes causal effect on maternal labor income. We establish the benefits of analyzing long term multiple benefits of these programs.
