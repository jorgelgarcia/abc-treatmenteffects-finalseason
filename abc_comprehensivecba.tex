\begin{abstract}
This paper estimates the diverse array of life-cycle benefits of an influential early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children and their families. The program is a prototype for numerous interventions in place around the world. It has substantial beneficial long-term effects on (a) health and the quality of life, (b) the earnings of participants, (c) the earnings of their mothers through subsidizing childcare, (d) crime, and (e) education. Benefits differ by gender. There are more substantial monetized benefits for boys. The overall rate of return is a statistically significant 13\% per annum with a benefit/cost ratio of 5.6, even after accounting for the welfare costs of taxation to finance the intervention. Estimates are robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses.

\section{Introduction}

This paper documents the diverse array of life-cycle benefits of an influential intensive early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children that starts in the first weeks of life. Different ways of characterizing the numerous benefits of the program all agree that the program has a substantial impact on the lives of participants. Monetizing benefits and costs across multiple domains produces policy-relevant and economically interpretable summaries of the program. It has a rate of return of 13\% per annum and a benefit/cost ratio of 5.6. There are substantial differences in benefits across genders.

This analysis contributes to a growing literature on the benefits of early interventions for disadvantaged children.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Currie_2011_AER} and \cite{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}.} Long-term evidence on their effectiveness is surprisingly limited.\footnote{The major source of evidence is from the Perry Preschool Program (see \citealp{Schweinhart_Montie_ea_2005_BOOKlifetime} and \citealp{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn,Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}), the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) (\citealp{Ramey_Campbell_etal_2000_ADS,Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}), and the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) (\citealp{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth,Duncan_Sojourner_2013_JHR}). IHDP was inspired by ABC/CARE \citep[][]{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth}.} For want of long-term followup data, many studies of early childhood interventions report outcomes at early ages. Moreover, they use only a limited set of outcomes like IQ or scores on school readiness measures.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Kline_Walters_2014_EvaluatingPublicPrograms} and \cite{Weiland_2013_CD_Impacts-of-Pre-K}.} Yet it is the long-term costs and benefits across multiple domains of life achievement that are relevant to policy analysis.

We present an array of \emph{long-term} benefits from two virtually identical early childhood interventions implemented in North Carolina and evaluated using random assignment. The programs are the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE), henceforth ABC/CARE. They were launched in the early 1970s and have long-term follow-ups through age 34. The program started early (at 8 weeks) and engaged participants to age 5. We analyze their impacts on a variety of life-relevant outcomes such as health, the quality of life, participation in crime, earnings, IQ, schooling, and the increase in mother's employment arising from program subsidies to childcare.

Evidence from these programs is relevant for today's policy discussions because their main features are present in a variety of programs currently in place around the world.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on ABC/CARE. The names of the programs with years launched and locations in parentheses are: IHDP---eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start in the U.S. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes (CLIO) study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Educare programs are also based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}.} The population targeted by the program still exists: roughly 19\% of all African-American children would be eligible for the program today.\footnote{43\% of African American children were eligible in 1972 \citep{Garcia_2016_National-Implementation-ECI}.}

Summarizing the benefits of a program with a diverse array of outcomes across many domains and periods of life is both challenging and rewarding. Doing so highlights the numerous channels through which early childhood programs enhance capabilities. We use a variety of methodologies to characterize program benefits. Instead of just reporting individual treatment effects by category, our cost/benefit analysis accounts for all program components, including the welfare cost of taxes to publicly finance these programs.\footnote{\cite{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} present a cost/benefit analysis for ABC for outcomes through age 21, before many benefits are realized. They report a benefit/cost ratio of 2.5, but give no standard error or sensitivity analysis for their estimate. They do not disaggregate by gender. For want of the data collected on health at age 34, they do not account for health benefits. They use self-reported crime data (unlike the administrative crime data later collected that we analyze) and ignore the welfare costs of financing the program. We use cost data from primary sources not available to them.}

A fundamental problem facing the evaluation of any human capital intervention is assessing future benefits of the program not yet surveyed.\footnote{\cite{Mincer_1974_schooling} addresses this problem using a synthetic cohort approach. See \cite{Heckman_Lochner_ea_2006_HEE}.} We address this problem by combining information from multiple panel data sources to project benefits and costs over the lifetimes of participants.\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{Ridder_Moffitt_2007_hbk_metricsdata} for a valuable discussion of data pooling methods.} We account for sampling uncertainty from pooling data and conduct sensitivity analyses of components for which sampling uncertainty is not readily quantified. Our approach to pooling multiple data sets and analyzing blocks of outcomes is of interest in its own right as a template for evaluating other programs with numerous outcomes, although this paper is not primarily methodological.

We add to the literature on evaluating early childhood programs by considering long-term benefits on health. We estimate the savings in life-cycle medical costs and improvements on the quality of life.\footnote{\cite{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} show the substantial adult (age 34) health benefits of ABC but do not present a cost/benefit analysis of their results.} We also find substantial childcare benefits that promote the work of mothers of participating children. There are substantial life-cycle benefits in terms of reduced crime, gains in life-cycle earnings, reduced special education costs, and enhanced educational attainment.

Figure~\ref{figure:npvsall} summarizes the main findings of the paper. It displays the discounted life-cycle program costs and benefits for male and female participants: costs are substantial, as has frequently been noted in public policy discussions.\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{Whitehurst_2014_Senate_Testimony} and \citet{Fox_News_2014_Head_Start_Effects}.} But so are benefits.

Note: This figure displays the life-cycle net present values of the main components of the cost/benefit analysis of ABC/CARE from birth to age 79, discounted to birth at a rate of 3\%.  By ``net" we mean that each component represents the total value for the treatment group minus the total value for the control group. Program costs: the total cost of implementing ABC/CARE. Total net benefits: the total net benefits of \textit{all} the components we consider. Labor income: total individual labor income from ages 20 to the retirement of program participants. Parental income: total parental labor income of the parents of the program participants from when the participants were ages 0 to 15. Crime: the total cost of crime (judicial and victimization costs). Total medical costs: both private and public medical costs from ages 15 to 79. Costs of education: the total costs of education of the individual from ages 6 to 26 and include any costs from special education and grade retention. \\
*QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years gain due to better health conditions through age 79.}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The rest of the paper justifies and interprets this figure. We proceed in the following way. Section~\ref{section:background} discusses main features of ABC/CARE. Section~\ref{section:methodology} discusses the methodological challenges faced in evaluating the program.

We use three main methodologies to incorporate the many outcomes measured across multiple stages of the life cycle: (a) treatment effects of ABC/CARE with additional inference that accounts for multiple hypothesis testing by adjusting $p$-values for the multiplicity of reported outcomes to avoid cherry-picking of ``significant'' results;\footnote{\cite{Romano_Wolf_2005_JASA}. For an application, see, e.g., \cite{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}.} (b) combining functions that summarize the \emph{number} of beneficial outcomes (as well as the number of statistically significant beneficial outcomes) within blocks of outcomes and overall. This gives a convenient summary of the mass of evidence in favor of program effects. Our principal tool is (c), cost/benefit and rate of return analysis, which monetizes the costs and benefits associated with outcomes. We also disaggregate net benefits by the categories depicted in Figure~\ref{figure:npvsall}.

Another methodological challenge is control group substitution bias.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_1992_randomization}, \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE}, and \cite{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}.} Roughly 70\% of our experimental control groups take some form of alternative preschool at least some of the time. We define and estimate counterfactuals corresponding to (i) treatment versus taking the next best option, (ii) treatment versus staying at home, and (iii) treatment versus attending an alternative preschool.

Section~\ref{section:results} reports and discusses our estimates. Estimates from different approaches agree. There are substantial benefits that differ by gender. Women benefit across more domains measured in terms of treatment effects. However, the monetized value of the positive treatment effects is greater for men. This is largely driven by the health benefits and reduction in crime for males. Section~\ref{section:conclusion} concludes.

\section[Background and Data Sources]{Background and Data Sources} \label{section:background}

\subsection{Overview}

ABC/CARE targeted disadvantaged children in Chapel Hill/Durham, North Carolina.\footnote{Both ABC and CARE were designed and implemented by researchers at the Frank Porter Graham Center of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.} Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison} presents an overview and compares the two programs. In the text, we summarize their main features. Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} describes these programs in detail. The goals of the intervention were to enhance the early-life skills of a disadvantaged population. The intervention (i) supported language, motor, and cognitive development; (ii) minimized high-risk behaviors; and (iii) developed socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task-orientation, communicative competence, independence, and pro-social behavior.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.}

The program provided individualized treatment. Infant caregivers recorded each child's progress and appropriately adapted learning activities every 2 to 3 weeks. Environments were organized to promote pre-literacy and access to a rich set of learning tools.\footnote{The ``Learningames'' approach was implemented by infant and toddler caregivers in 1:1 child-adult interactions. Each ``Learningames'' activity stated a developmentally-appropriate objective, the necessary materials, directions for teacher behavior, and expected child outcome.} The curriculum emphasized active learning experiences, dramatic play, and basic ideas of order and category (pre-academic skills), as well as discipline and the ability to interact with and respect others.  At later ages (3 through 5), the program became increasingly structured, focusing on the development of pre-academic skills and ``socio-linguistic and communicative competence.''\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Haskins_1985_CD, Ramey_1981_Modification, Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree,Sparling_Lewis_1984_BOOKLearningGamesThreesFours}.}

ABC recruited four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1976. CARE recruited two cohorts of children, born in 1978 and 1979. The recruitment processes for each study were identical. Potential participant families were referred to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother's last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was determined by a score of 11 or above on a High-risk Index (HRI).\footnote{Examples of variables in the HRI are maternal education and father's stability at work. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for details on the construction of the HRI.}

As detailed in Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison}, the design and implementation of both ABC and CARE were similar. ABC had two phases, the first of which lasted from birth until age 5. In this phase, children were randomly assigned to either a treatment group that received center-based childcare or a control group. The second phase of treatment consisted of academic support from ages 5 through 8. CARE consisted of two treatment phases that were very similar to those of ABC. The first phase of CARE, also lasting from birth until age 5, contained an additional arm of treatment that involved family education. This arm was designed to study the effects of improving the home environment on child development.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.}

In our analysis, we pool the treatment group in CARE that received the center-based ABC curriculum with the ABC treatment group. We do not use the CARE treatment group that only received family education.\footnote{\citet{ABCCARE_Dataset} show that there is no effect of the CARE family education component alone.} We only consider the intervention through age 5.\footnote{The second-phase treatment of ABC/CARE had no effects \citep{ABCCARE_Dataset}.}

\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{table}


For both programs, from birth until the age of 8, data were collected annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environment, family structure, and family economic characteristics. After age 8, data on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, education, and family economic characteristics were collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, measures of cognitive skills are unavailable for both ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have unique administrative criminal records and a full medical survey at age 34. This allows us to study the long-term effects of the programs along multiple dimensions of human development. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:data} for a more comprehensive description of the data.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:randomization}, we document the balance in observed baseline characteristics across the treatment and control groups, once we drop the individuals for whom we have crime or health information, for which there is substantial attrition. Further, the methodology we propose addresses missing information in either of these two outcome categories.}

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises} \label{section:randomization}

The randomization of both ABC and CARE were conducted at the family level, so pairs of siblings and twins were jointly randomized into either treatment or control groups.\footnote{Sibling pairs occurred when the two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that pairing was based on HRI, maternal IQ, maternal education, maternal age, and gender of the subject, we do not know the original pairs. ABC collected an initial sample of 122 subjects. 22 subjects did not complete the first-phase of treatment as initially assigned by the randomization. We characterize each of the cases in Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} and document that our estimates are robust when we adjust for missing data using the methods discussed in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:controls}, we compare the observed, baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} to the observed, baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.}


\subsection{Control Group Substitution}

In both ABC and CARE, many control group subjects attended alternative preschools.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE} on the issue of substitution bias on social experiments.} In ABC, \treatsubsabc\ of control-group subjects were enrolled in one of 11 local center-based childcare centers. In CARE, \treatsubscarec\ of the control group were enrolled in alternative preschools. Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare} shows the cumulative densities of the proportion of time the subject was enrolled in alternative preschool from birth to age 5. Figure~\ref{fig:proportion-alt-pre} shows that those in the control group who were enrolled in alternative preschool tended to be enrolled for 3 years.

Most of these alternative preschools received federal subsidies and were federally regulated. Their staff members were required to be trained in early childhood education, and the centers were required to implement approved curricula designed to enhance cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev}.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Program Costs} \label{section:programscosts}

Costs are a fundamental component to the benefit/cost ratio and the internal rate of return. We improve on previous estimates of the costs by using primary-source documentation.\footnote{These are progress reports written by the principal investigators and related documentation recovered in the archives of the research center where the program was implemented. We display these sources in Appendix \ref{app:programcosts}.}

Table~\ref{tab:totalcosts} breaks down costs by different categories for a year of treatment. We obtain the personnel wages from the primary sources we show in Appendix \ref{app:programcosts} and include the type of personnel based on conversations with the programs' staff. We adjust wages upward by 15\% to account for fringe benefits. The costs we label as ``other'' arise from nutrition and services that the subjects received when they were sick, diapers during the first 15 months of their lives, and transportation to the center.\footnote{The control children also received diapers during approximately 15 months, and iron-fortified formula. We assume that this generated a cost that amounts to half of the ``other'' category for the first 15 months of their lives.} The costs are based on sources describing ABC treatment for $52$ children.\footnote{We use the same costs estimates for CARE, for which information is less available.} The costs exclude any expenses related to research or policy analysis.\footnote{Our calculation of the costs per year in 1979 USD is $\$295,239$. A separate calculation of the program as implemented indicates that the yearly cost of the program was $\$275,475$ (1979 USD). See Appendix \ref{app:programcosts}.}

\footnotesize
\input{output/programcosts}
\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item Note: This table summarizes the yearly costs for ABC/CARE. They are based on primary-source documentation describing ABC. We assume that the costs for ABC and CARE were the same based on conversations with programs' staff \citep{projectcare2014interviews,abc2014-2015interviews}. \\
\item Sources: See Appendix~\ref{app:programcosts}.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

\subsection{Non-experimental Data Sources}

Our cost-benefit analysis requires (i) \textit{interpolation} of components we do not observe due to intermittent data collection; and (ii) \textit{extrapolation} or forecasting of components we do not observe because the follow-ups stop when the subjects were in their mid-30s. We use multiple sources of non-experimental data representative on the national or state level to construct these interpolations and extrapolations. Table~\ref{table:sources} details the components for which we do these exercises and the sources we use. Section~\ref{section:methodology} explains our methodology for doing so.

\section{Methodology} \label{section:methodology}

\subsection{Sample Size}

Findings from ABC/CARE have been criticized given the programs' small sample size.\footnote{See Charles Murray's commentary in \citep
{Heckman_2013_BOOKGivingkidsfair}.} An extensive analysis by \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} shows that asymptotic inference and permutation-based inference, specifically suited for small-sample inference, agree to great extent for the ABC sample. We consider an even bigger sample than \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} by including CARE. For this reason, we do not use small-sample inference, such as permutation testing.\footnote{For interested readers, we are able to provide treatment effects based on permutation testing.}

\textbf{[JJH: Need to discuss small sample issue. Cite Murray -- commenting on my book ``Give Kids'' (his comment in book).] [Typist: See below.]}

\subsection{Parameters of Interest and Policy Questions} \label{section:methodsquestions}

Random assignment to treatment alone does not guarantee that conventional treatment-effect estimates commonly used in the literature are able to answer policy-relevant questions. For an estimator to be useful in policy design, it should relate to a relevant parameter by clearly stating the counterfactual scenario to which the evaluated program is being compared. We define three parameters and link them to different policy questions.

Let $Y$ denote an outcome of interest. $D$ indicates whether or not the parents of the subject agree to participate of the program and $R | D = 1$ denotes randomization to either treatment or control status. $T$ denotes the number of periods during the first phase of treatment---5 years, and $t$ is a realization in $\left\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5 \right\}$.\footnote{We define parameters that are conditional on the parents agreeing to participate in the program, i.e., conditional on $D = 1$. We find little sensitivity to the few cases of non-compliance in Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} and adjust our estimates for the cases of attrition as we explain in Appendix~\ref{appendix:attrition}.} We consider two counterfactual outcomes under control status, with individual subscripts omitted for simplicity:
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_H^0\left(t \right) &:& \textbf{ Subject stays at home in time period $t$} \nonumber \\
Y_C^0\left(t \right) &:& \textbf{ Subject attends alternative preschool in time period $t$}.  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Given $U(.)$ as the utility associated with ``." we define the proportion of months in alternative preschool as
\begin{equation}
V : = \frac{\# \{ t: U(Y_H^0 \left( t \right)) < U(Y_C^0 \left( t \right)) \} }{T}.
\end{equation}

We simplify the analysis by assuming that timing is irrelevant for the realization of the outcome:\footnote{Describing the dynamic choices underlying $V$ is of interest but goes beyond the scope of this paper.}
\begin{align}
Y_H^0 \left( t \right) &= Y_H^0 \nonumber \\
Y_C^0 \left( t \right) &= Y_C^0.
\end{align}
\textbf{[JJH: All programs alike]} The counterfactual outcome when the child is in control status with an explicit dependence on $V$ is
\begin{equation}
Y^0 : = \left( 1 - V \right) Y_H^0 + \left( V \right) Y_C^0.
\end{equation}

There are two possible approaches to treat $V$. The first is to simplify $V$ as binary, where $V = 0$ or $V  > 0$. The second is to allow for multiple values of $V$ (let $V$ be continuous in the limit). While the continuous approach would allow us to construct the counterfactual $Y_C^0 \left( V \right)$ specific to a realization of $V \in [0,1]$, it is problematic in the context of the small number of observations in ABC/CARE. The binary approach still allows us to define policy-relevant parameters. Under this approach, we can frame the parental decision in a standard Roy-type setting in which\footnote{We present estimates for different versions of this Roy model in Appendix~\ref{appendix:amethodology}.}

\begin{equation}
\Pr \left[ U \left(Y^1 \right) \geq  \max \left\{ U \left(  Y_{H}^0 \right),  U\left(Y_{C}^0 \right) \right\} \vert D =  1\right] = 1.
\label{eq:noutility}
\end{equation}

We focus on simple parameters that we can directly use in the cost-benefit analysis. The first parameter of interest relates to the following question: what is the effect of the program as implemented? That is, what is the effect of the program without fixing the parental decision to enroll the subject in alternative preschool? Importantly, this parameter does not speak to the effectiveness of the program by itself. Instead, it speaks to the effectiveness of the program relative to the supply of alternatives preschools that was in place when the program was implemented. The parameter is:

\begin{equation}
\Delta := \mathbb{E} \left[ Y^1 -  \max \left\{ Y_{H}^0,  Y_{C}^0 \right\} | D =1 \right]. \label{eq:mainest}
\end{equation}

\noindent Random assignment to either the treatment or control group allows us to identify this parameter.

It is more policy-relevant to inquire on the efficiency of a program with respect to a clearly stated counterfactual. For example, we can ask: what is the effectiveness of the program with respect to a counterfactual in which the child stays at home? The parameter associated with this question is:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \left(V = 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ Y^1 \left( V \right) - Y^0 \left( V \right) | V = 0, D = 1 \right]. \label{eq:par0}
\end{equation}

\noindent Random assignment to the treatment group does not directly identify this parameter. We approximate \eqref{eq:par0} with the following estimator: 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\Delta} \left(V = 0 \right) : = \widehat{\mathbf{E}} \left[ Y | R = 1, V \in \left[ 0 , \eta \right], D = 1 \right] - \widehat{\mathbf{E}} \left[ Y | R = 0, V \in \left[ 0 , \eta \right], D = 1 \right] \label{eq:estimates0}
\end{equation}
where $\eta \rightarrow 0$ and $\widehat{\mathbf{E}}[\cdot]$ represents an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$. That is, we compare the subjects randomly assigned to treatment with the subjects randomly assigned to control in a neighborhood where subjects are not likely to select into preschool alternatives. Various matching estimators allow us to estimate how likely subjects are to take preschool alternatives, based on observed characteristics.\footnote{\citet{Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1997_REStud,Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1998_REStud}.} We provide different versions of these estimators below.

Similarly, we define a parameter that allows us to compare the effectiveness of the program relative to the alternative preschools:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \left( V > 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E} \left[ Y^1 \left(V \right) - Y^0 \left( V \right) | V > 0, D = 1 \right] \label{eq:par1}
\end{equation}
and provide an estimate analogous to \eqref{eq:estimates0}. The parameters in \eqref{eq:par0} and \eqref{eq:par1} address control substitution, in the sense that they fix the counterfactual comparison accounting for the decisions that the parents make to enroll children in alternative preschools.

\subsection{Testing Multiple Hypotheses}  \label{section:counts}

We are interested in the effects that ABC/CARE has on multiple dimensions of human development. We have measures of outcomes from very early in life to the mid-30s. This generates a problem of testing multiple hypotheses. Two possible approaches are: (i) adjust the inference to account for the correlation of the outcomes using a step-down procedure;\footnote{\citet{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat,Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}.} and (ii) monetize the outcomes to produce a cost/benefit analysis. In this section, we provide an intermediate alternative that informs on the relative importance of different outcomes in the cost-benefit analysis.

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the index set for different groups of outcomes and let $\mathcal{O}^{g}$ be a group of outcomes, with $g \in \mathcal{G}$. Let $F_{j}^r \left( Y_{j}^r \right) $ be the marginal distribution of outcome $j$ in group $g$ and $r \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$, where $R = r$ denotes treatment status. Assume that we want to perform inference on estimates of parameters of the type \eqref{eq:mainest} across multiple outcomes. That is, inference on

\begin{equation}
\Delta_{j} := \mathbb{E} \left[ Y_{j}^1 -  \max \left\{  Y_{j,H}^0 ,  Y_{j,C}^0 \right\} | D =1 \right] \label{eq:m-hyp-d-param}
\end{equation}
for the group of outcomes, $\mathcal{O}^{g}$. We want to test the null hypothesis
\begin{equation}
H_{0} : F_{j}^0 = F_{j}^1, \ \forall \ j \in \mathcal{O}^{g}.
\end{equation}

\noindent In practice, we test the hypothesis
\begin{equation}
H_{0} : \Delta_{j} = 0, \ \forall \ j \in \mathcal{O}^{g}.
\end{equation}

\noindent We use the following statistic to test this hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
T_{g} = \sum _{j=1}^{\# \mathcal{O}^g} \mathbf{1} \left[ \widehat{\Delta}_{j} > 0\right] \label{eq:count}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\widehat{\Delta}_{j}$ is the estimator of \eqref{eq:m-hyp-d-param}.

For inference purposes, we bootstrap this procedure and construct a null distribution. The $p$-value for the number of socially positive treatment effects in group $g$ is $1 - \widehat{F}_{g} \left( T_{g} \right)$, where $ \widehat{F}_{g}$ is the empirical bootstrap distribution of group $g$.\footnote{For the case where we count the number of positive and significant outcomes, we use a ``double bootstrap'' to produce an inference on the count. We resample $B_{0}$ times to obtain the $p$-value for testing the hypothesis of interest for each individual outcome. This allows us to compute the number of positive and significant treatment effects, for example. We repeat this procedure $B_{1}$ times to obtain a distribution for this count. Thus, the double bootstrap consists of $B_{0} \times B_{1}$ data resamplings.}

Alternatively, we can count the positive treatment effects in the outcomes across each of the groups indexed by the set $\mathcal{G}$. This allows us to avoid (i) arbitrarily picking outcomes that have statistically significant effects---``cherry picking''; or (ii) arbitrarily blocking sets of outcomes to correct the $p$-values when accounting for multiple hypothesis testing. 

We provide inference on this count of positive treatment effects as well as the count of treatment effects that are both positive and significant, for which the inference is analogous. We also provide counts for the parameters that account for control substitution. 

\subsection{Forecasting and Monetizing Life-cycle Costs and Benefits} \label{section:cbamethodology}

\noindent In this section, we explain our strategy to interpolate and extrapolate the life-cycle costs and benefits of education, labor income, crime, and health.\footnote{The methodology for doing this exercise for parental and public-transfer income is analogous to that of labor income so we suppress the description for brevity.} More methodological and practical details are in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}, in which we also explain a solution for cases of attrition when forecasting. 

\subsubsection{Education}

Follow-up data on educational attainment were collected up to age 30. In Appendix \ref{appendix:education}, we show that education up to this age is an accurate portrayal of lifetime educational attainment. Therefore, we do not actually forecast beyond age 30. To monetize the costs of education, we consider the public costs of K-12 education and the private costs of post-secondary education, including vocational programs and community college. Other costs of education include grade retention and special education.

\subsubsection{Labor Income}

We observe labor income at ages 21 and 30. To construct a life-cycle profile, we interpolate between ages 21 and 30 and extrapolate from ages 31 to 67, at which point we assume the subjects retire. Recall that $R$ indicates whether the subject was randomized to the treatment group ($R=1$) or to the control group ($R=0$), conditional on having agreed to participate in the program ($D = 1$). $Y$ is the outcome for which we want to produce a forecast---interpolation or extrapolation. In this case, the outcome is labor income. $X$ is a vector of observed characteristics, possibly affected by the treatment---e.g. lagged values of $Y$; $W$ is a vector of baseline characteristics---e.g. race and gender; $S$ indicates whether we observe $Y$ in the experimental sample ($S=1$) or an auxiliary, non-experimental data source ($S=0$). For simplicity, we suppress $D$ and individual and time subscripts. \\

We aim to identify

\begin{equation}
Y = \phi \left( R, X, W, S \right) + \varepsilon \label{eq:forecast-param}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we assume that the outcome of interest is an additively separable function of the known objects $R, X, W, S$ and an unobserved component $\varepsilon$.

Identifying $\phi \left( R, X, W, S \right)$ requires some assumptions. Because the forecast is based on observed characteristics, $X$, we require the auxiliary datasets to share the support on observed characteristics with the experimental dataset:

\begin{equation}
\sup \left( X | S = 1 \right) \subseteq \sup \left( X | S = 0 \right).
\end{equation}

Given that we are not able to observe $R$ in the auxiliary dataset, we assume that we are able to summarize the impacts that the treatment has on the outcomes with observed characteristics. That is, we are assuming the conditional independence and sufficiency of $S, X$, and $W$ to describe treatment. Formally, let the $^{*}$ superscript denote variables we do not observe. In the auxiliary dataset we have: $\left( S = 0, Y, X, W, R^* \right)$. In the experimental dataset we have: $\left( S = 1, Y^*, X, W, R \right)$. This assumption can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = s\right] =  \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = s\right]
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x^r$ is a draw from the distribution of $X | R = r$.

To be able to fully ``link" the individuals in the auxiliary with those in the experimental datasets to produce forecasts, we must make a similar assumption. We assume that we can summarize the difference between the individuals in the experimental datasets and those in the auxiliary datasets based on observed characteristics. This conditional independence and sufficiency of $X, W$, and $R$ to describe the presence of an individual in the data is written formally as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y^* | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = 1 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R^* = r , X = x, W = w, S = 0\right].
\end{equation}

These assumptions allow us to compute the estimator of \eqref{eq:forecast-param}: 

\begin{equation}
\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\phi} \left( R, X, W, S = 1 \right) + \widehat{\varepsilon},   \label{eq:additive}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi \left( R, X, W, S \right) : = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = s \right] $ and $\widehat{\varepsilon}$ is a forecasting error. 

These assumptions imply that

\begin{equation}
\phi \left( R, X, W, S = 1 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]$ is a moment in the auxiliary dataset. The estimation of $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]$ produces a residual of the form $\widehat{\varepsilon} : = Y - \widehat{Y}$ for each individual. The forecast for each  individual outcome consists of $\widehat{\phi} \left( \cdot \right)$ and a draw from the empirical distribution of $\widehat{\varepsilon}$, which we call forecast error. We account for this error when interpolating and extrapolating the crime and health outcomes in addition to income.

\subsubsection{Crime}  \label{sec:crime}

To estimate the life-cycle benefits and costs of ABC/CARE related to criminal activity, we use rich data on crime outcomes.\footnote{Two previous studies consider the impacts of ABC on crime: \citet{Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ} use administrative crime records up to age 21, and find no significant differences between the treatment and the control groups. \cite{Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} mention crime in their cost-benefit analysis, but they cite the previous study to claim that there are no savings coming from a reduction in crime.} See Appendix \ref{appendix:crime} for a more complete explanation of the following procedures.

We consider the following types of crime: arson, assault, burglary, fraud, larceny, miscellaneous (which includes traffic and non-violent drug crimes), murder, vehicle theft, rape, robbery, and vandalism. We use administrative data that detail: (i) youth arrests, gathered at the age-21 follow-up; (ii) adult arrests, gathered at the age-34 follow-up; and (iii) sentences, gathered at the age-34 follow-up. We also use self-reported data on adult crimes, gathered in the age-21 and age-30 subject interviews. Because none of these sources capture all criminal activity, it is necessary to combine them to more completely approximate the crimes the subjects committed. We also use several auxiliary datasets to complete the life-cycle profile of criminal activity and compute the costs of the committed crimes

We follow four steps to estimate the costs of crime. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Count arrests and sentences.} We start by counting the total number of sentences for each individual and type of crime (arson, assault, etc.) up to age 34, matching crimes across data sources, to construct the total number of  arrests for each individual and type of crime up to age 34.\footnote{In practice, we count all offenses (an arrest might include multiple offenses). This gives the correct number of victims for our estimations. The youth data have coarser categories than the rest of the data: violent, property, drug, and other. To match these data with the adult data, we assume that all property crimes were larcenies and that all violent crimes are assaults. In the ABC/CARE sample, assault is the most common type of violent crime, and larceny/theft is the most common property crime.} For individuals missing arrest data,\footnote{About 10\% of the ABC/CARE sample has missing arrest data.} we impute the number of arrests by multiplying the number of sentences for each type of crime by a national arrest-sentence ratio for the respective crime.\footnote{This arrest-sentence ratio is constructed using the National Crime Victimization Survey (NJRP) and and the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics (UCRS).}

\item \textit{Construct predictions.} Based on the sentences observed before age 34, we predict the sentences that the ABC/CARE subjects will have after age 34. Data from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (NCDPS), which provide lifetime sentences of individuals in North Carolina, are used to estimate sentences incurred after age 34 from sentences incurred before age 34. Applying these models to the ABC/CARE data, we predict the number of future sentences for each subject up to age 50.\footnote{We assume that individuals with no criminal records before age 34 commit no crimes after age 34.} We then add these estimates to the original number of sentences, getting an estimate of the lifetime sentences. Adding these estimates increases the total count of crimes by 30\%--50\%. 

\item \textit{Estimate number of victims from the crimes.} We only observe crimes that resulted in consequences in the justice system: crimes that resulted in arrests and/or sentences. To include unobserved crimes, we use victimization inflation (VI).\footnote{Previous papers using this method include \citet{Belfield_Nores_etal_2006_JHR} and \cite{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}.} We start by constructing a VI ratio, which is the national ratio of victims and arrests for each type of crime.\footnote{We assume that each crime with victims is counted separately in the national reports on arrests, even for arrests that might have been motivated by more than one crime. This victim-arrest ratio is constructed using the NJRP and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).} Then, we estimate the number of victims from the crimes committed by ABC/CARE subjects as their total arrests multiplied by the VI ratio.\footnote{Additionally, we can calculate an analogous estimate of the number of crime victims using sentences, based on the VI ratio and the national arrests-to-sentences ratio. Both estimates are very similar, as shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}. To improve precision, the estimates in the rest of our paper are based on the average of the two calculations.}

\item \textit{Find total costs of crimes.} We use the estimates of the cost of crimes for victims from \cite{McCollister_etal_2010_DAD} to impute the total victimization costs. For crimes resulting in arrests and/or sentences, we consider justice system costs as well, such as police costs.\footnote{To be able to assign costs to each type of crime, we assume that the cost of the justice system depends on the number of offenses of each type, rather than on the number of arrests. While this could very slightly overestimate justice system costs, the costs only represent about 5\% of the total crime costs.} Finally, we construct the total costs of incarceration for each subject using the total prison time and the cost of a day in prison.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Health} \label{section:health}

To forecast and monetize health outcomes, we consider three issues: (i) health outcomes such as diabetes or heart disease are absorbing states; (ii) health outcomes are highly interdependent within and across time periods; and (iii) there is no evident time period available to finish accounting for benefits and costs.\footnote{For example, for income we extrapolate up to the retirement age of 67. However, for health, we need to predict an age of death for each individual.} It is not sufficient to condition on observed characteristics to recover a credible estimate of the treatment effect. Instead, we use an adaptation of the Future America Model (FAM) that projects health outcomes from the subjects' mid-30s up to their projected death \citep{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-Elderly-Model-Report}.\footnote{The simulation starts at the age in which we observe the subject's age-34 health follow-up. On average this happened at age 34 for both males and females, but there is variation ranging from age 30 to age 37.} Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} provides a thorough discussion of the FAM methodology.

 The methodology has six steps: (i) estimate the age-by-age health state transition probabilities using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); (ii) match these transition probabilities to the ABC/CARE subjects based on observed characteristics; (iii) estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) models using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the PSID; (iv) estimate medical cost models using the MEPS and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), allowing estimates to differ by health state and observed characteristics; and (v) predict the medical expenditure and QALYs that correspond to the simulated individual health trajectories.\footnote{As an intermediate step between (i) and (ii), we impute some of the variables used to initialize the FAM models (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:health}).}

Our microsimulation model starts the health predictions at age 30, with the information on observed characteristics available at this age. Restricting it to the individuals for whom we have information from the age-34 health follow-up allows us to account for components that are crucial for predicting health outcomes, such as the body mass index (BMI). The models predict the probability of being in any of the states in the horizontal axis of Table~\ref{table:transition} at age $a+1$ based on the state at age $a$, which is described by the vertical axis of the table.\footnote{In practice, the predictions are based on two-year lags, due to data limitations in the auxiliary sources we use to simulate the FAM. For example, if the individual is 30 (31) years old in the age-30 interview, we simulate the trajectory of her health status at ages 30 (31), 32 (33), 34 (35), and so on until her projected death.} Absorbing states are an exception. For example, heart disease at age $a$ does not enter in the estimation of transitions for heart disease at age $a+1$ because it is an absorbing state: once a person has heart disease, she carries it through the rest of her life.\footnote{The same is true for chronic or permanent conditions such as hypertension, having a stroke, etc.}

At each age, once we obtain the transition probability for each health outcome, we draw a Monte-Carlo simulation for each subject. Thus, each simulation depends on each individual's health history and on their particular characteristics. For every simulated trajectory of health outcomes, we predict the lifetime medical expenditure using the models estimated from the MEPS and the MCBS. We then obtain an estimate of the expected lifetime medical expenditure by taking the mean of each individual's simulated lifetime medical expenditure. 

The same procedure is applied to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\footnote{A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) reweighs a year of life according to its quality given the burden of disease. A QALY of 1 denotes a year of life in the absence of disease (perfect health). The value of QALY for an individual in a given year is smaller than 1 when there is positive burden of disease, as worse health conditions imply lower QALYs. When an individual dies, her QALY equals zero. It is worth noting that there are extreme combinations of disease and disability that may generate negative QALYs, although this case is unusual.} We compute a QALY model based on the EQ-5D instrument, a widely-used Health-related Quality-of-life (HRQoL) measure, available in MEPS. We then estimate this model from the PSID.

\end{threeparttable}
\end{sidewaystable}

We estimate three models of medical spending: (i) Medicare spending (annual medical spending paid by parts A, B, and D of Medicare); (ii) out-of-pocket spending (medical spending paid directly by the individual); and (ii) all public spending other than Medicare. Each medical spending model is estimated through pooled weighted least squares regressions that include a person's demographics, economic status, current health, risk factors, and functional status as explanatory variables. The MCBS-based medical spending models also include lagged health because of the length of time for which MCBS subjects are observed.

We also calculate medical expenditure before age 30. We combine the MEPS and retrospective information in the ABC/CARE interviews at ages 21 and 30 related to hospitalizations at ages 12 and 15 and births at age 15. In addition to this retrospective information, we use use individual and family demographics to predict medical expenditure models for each age.

The first level of each model predicts the likelihood that the subject incurred any medical expenditure in the period. The second level predicts the medical expenditure for those with positive expenditures.

\section{Results} \label{section:results}

\subsection{Treatment Effects} \label{section:teresults}

We present an overview of treatment effects in Table~\ref{resultsfemales} and Table~\ref{resultsmales}. Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} displays an extensive summary. We select these outcomes because we consider them of economic interest.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} displays results accounting for multiple hypothesis testing as in \citet{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat} and \citet{Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}. We do not lose significance in the main outcomes driving the cost/benefit analysis.}

The results for females indicate an increase in employment, which strengthens when comparing to the females who did not receive alternative preschool. Females in the treatment group were more likely to graduate from high school and receive more years of education than those in the control group. These education results are robust even after fixing the take-up of alternative preschool. 

The robust results for males are seen in health outcomes as opposed to education outcomes. Treated subjects reported lower drug use and blood pressure. The results for employment, hypertension, blood pressure, and graduation from a 4-year college are strengthened when fixing the control group to those subjects who attended alternative preschools. This is an opposite trend from the results of the females.

\subsection{Combining Functions} \label{section:c-functions}

In our combining functions, we consider \noutcomes\ measures of human development across the life cycle and count the measures for which the program had a ``socially positive'' effect, without accounting for control substitution.\footnote{These outcomes directly relate to the categories we monetize in the cost/benefit analysis. We analyze a more thorough list of outcomes in Appendix~\ref{appendix:moreoutcomes}. The results weaken, but not to a great extent. This is a consequence of adding outcomes for which it is not clear that treatment should have a positive treatment effect.} Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} displays the results from this exercise: ABC/CARE positively impacts a large percentage of the outcomes we consider.\footnote{We discuss the calculation of the standard errors follows from the bootstrap procedure in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.}

We can further decompose the counts in Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} into categories that are relevant to the cost/benefit analysis. Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivecategory1} and Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivecategory2} present this exercise pooling males and females. This helps us better understand the type of outcomes ABC/CARE affected. The results indicate that a large and precise fraction of effects are positive for outcomes spanning the life cycle, including a wide variety of health categories.

\subsection{Cost/benefit Analysis} \label{section:cbaresults}

Figure~\ref{figure:npvs} presents the net present values for the main components of the cost/benefit analysis pooling males and females. The ``Baseline'' bars represent the estimates based on the first parameter of interest, comparing the treatment- to the control-group subjects. The ``Stay at Home'' bars represent the comparison between the treatment-group and the control-group subjects who stayed at home. The ``Alternative Preschool'' bars represent the comparison between the treatment-group and the control-group subjects who attended alternative preschools.

The first category, ``Costs," represents the cost of the programs' implementation. The second category, ``Total Net Benefits" quantifies the benefits for the treatment-group subjects net of the benefits of the control-group subjects. Labor income has two components, ``Labor Income" and ``Parental Income." The program produces a positive net present value on labor income of the treated subjects. This considers the income from age 21 all the way to retirement. However it is important to account for the fact that the parents of the treatment-group subjects increased their labor supply and therefore their income. The net present value of parental income span the first 15 years of the treatment and control children.

Crime is an important component, which is consistent with previous analysis of early childhood education programs.\footnote{\citet{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}.} We then present two main categories for health, ``QALYs" and ``Medical Costs." As documented in \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}, ABC/CARE had substantial effects on several measures of long-term health, especially for males---e.g. body-mass index, systolic and diastolic pressure, Framigham risk index. This translates into a higher probability of survival at later ages. Thus, individuals in the treatment group incur higher medical costs. However, their health conditions enable them to lead higher quality lives, which is reflected in the net gain the program generates in the QALYs. Finally, we present the net present value of education costs. It is negative because subjects in the treatment group acquired more education throughout their life cycles. 

It is important to note that although the net present values from the three comparisons imply that ABC/CARE is socially beneficial regardless of control substitution, the magnitudes for some of the components do vary substantially. We argue that this has to do with the differential treatment effects of ABC/CARE by gender. As Figure~\ref{figure:npvsf} and Figure~\ref{figure:npvsm} show, males benefit much more when the counterfactual scenario is to attend alternative preschools, while females benefit much more from the program when the counterfactual scenario is to stay at home.

We analyze the internal rate of return and cost-benefit ratio implied by the net present values presented in Figure~\ref{figure:npvs} through Figure~\ref{figure:npvsm}. These results without accounting for control substitution are presented in Table~\ref{table:cba}. All the monetary figures are in 2014 USD and are discounted to each child's birth.

Pooling males and females, the results indicate that the program is socially efficient: the baseline estimates for the internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio are \irrp\ and \bcp. The program generates a benefit of \bcp\ for every dollar spent on it. This is of particular importance because ABC/CARE was much more expensive than other early childhood education programs---the treatment involved more services over a longer time period.\citet{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}

The internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are robust to sensitivity exercises. First, we remove the component due to parental income. In practice, ABC/CARE had a childcare subsidy component because it allowed the mothers to work causing additional parental income. This component amounts to \parincomenpvp. Even after removing this component, the internal rate of return and benefit/cost ratio indicate social efficiency of the program and remain statistically significant.

Parental income and crime are the components for which the internal rate of return and the benefit/cost ratio are the most sensitive.\footnote{We do not account for treatment effects on parental income beyond age 15 because some subjects report to move out of their households as early as this age. This makes ambiguous the effects that parental income could have on the subjects after age 15.} The reason for the sensitivity to parental income is that the amount is substantial and it is not heavily discounted because it accumulates during the first $15$ years of the children's life. Although crime is subject to more discounting, the amount due to crime savings is large so removing it diminishes both the internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio.

The estimates are robust to individually removing the rest of the components, and in most cases remain statistically significant. This happens for one of either two reasons: (i) the effects are substantial but they are heavily discounted because they happen later in life---e.g. labor income; or (ii) the effects happen early in life but are not as substantial---as in the amount that the control-group parents pay for their children to attend alternative preschools.

Next, we analyze the estimates when splitting the sample by males and females. Some of the estimates lose significance due to the reduction of observations after splitting the sample by gender. The point estimates remain robust across  the sensitivity analysis (see Table~\ref{table:cba}), which computes the benefit/cost ratio and the internal rate of return when removing a component. For females, we observe consistency except for the case where we remove the parental income component. We can observe that the female sample is the main driver of parental income when comparing its net present value between females and males. For males, the estimates are robust, similar to the female sample.

\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item Note: This table presents the estimates of the net present value (NPV) for each component, and the internal rate of return (IRR) and the benefit/cost ratio (B/C) of ABC/CARE for different scenarios based on comparing the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned as control in ABC/CARE. The first row represents the baseline estimates. The rest of the rows present estimates for scenarios in which we remove the NPV estimates of the component listed in the first column. The quantity listed in the NPV columns is the component we actually remove when computing the calculation in each row. All the money figures are in 2014 USD and are discounted to each child's birth, unless otherwise specified. For the B/C we use a discount rate of $3\%$, unless otherwise specified. We test the null hypotheses $\text{IRR} = 3\%$ and $\text{B/C} = 1$---we elect $3\%$ because that is the discount rate we use. The results in bold are significant at the 10\% level in a single-sided, non-parametric, bootstrapped test. We resample both the experimental and the auxiliary data sources.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

We provide a cost-benefit analysis of the program when accounting for control substitution (Table~\ref{table:cbacs}). The first row shows the estimates without accounting for control substitution, i.e. the same as those of the first row in Table~\ref{table:cba}. The second and third rows present results for the two counterfactual comparisons we consider.

It is worth noting that the sample sizes for some of the cases make the IRR estimates very unstable. For example, the estimates for females compared to the counterfactual of staying at home are based on an initial sample of 5 observations in the control group, while the estimates for males are based on 7  observations in the control group.\footnote{That is, we observe 5 females and 7 males in the control group who did not attend alternative preschools. Some of the forecasts could be based on even smaller samples due to missing values in some specific outcomes.} In the specific case of females, the internal rate of return corresponding to the counterfactual of staying at home is based on crossing net-benefit streams. Similarly, we cannot obtain a real solution for the case of males.

The samples used to produce estimates relative to enrollment in alternatives preschools are larger than those previously mentioned and we are able to obtain real solutions for the IRR even after splitting by males and females. The results are consistent with the treatment effects we show in Section~\ref{section:teresults}. Compared to ABC/CARE, females benefit more than males from alternative preschools relative to staying at home. That is, the benefit/cost ratio of ABC/CARE relative to staying at home is high for females and low for males. Conversely, the benefit/cost ratio of ABC/CARE relative to alternative preschools is high for males and low for females. Given the outcomes that we are able to monetize have higher values for males than for females, the pooled results are more similar to the results for males than to the results for females. Regardless, any of the counterfactual comparisons we consider indicates that ABC/CARE is socially efficient.

\section{Summary} \label{section:conclusion}

The evidence from policies related to early childhood education is still scarce despite its importance in the public debate. We provide a thorough evaluation of two randomized controlled trials: the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE).

As programs providing high-quality center-based childcare, ABC/CARE has positive effects on a variety of outcomes measuring human development throughout childhood to adulthood---including cognition, socio-emotional skills, criminal activity, and adulthood health. This translates into statistically and economically significant measures of social efficiency, like the benefit-cost ratio and the internal rate of return, which we calculate accounting for complications that arise when evaluating social programs and considering life-cycle gains.

When adequately assessed, early childhood education programs enhance human development in that they provide a vehicle to promote social mobility. An adequate evaluation requires: (i) comparing the program with respect to a well-defined counterfactual---e.g. other programs or staying at home; and (ii) monetizing the life-cycle gains, which goes beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations based on short-term gains.
