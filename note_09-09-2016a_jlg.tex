\noindent Professor, \\

\noindent I have finished: (i) answering your questions and implementing your edits to the appendix, so you can begin at the crime appendix if you want to go ahead with the progress you made a day ago; (ii) forecasting the QALYs for the PSID disadvantaged individuals (you can see that in the paper now); (iii) answering the questions/requests you had today in the main paper; (iv) documenting the cross-walk---please revisit Appendix D if you want to see this.\\

\noindent I'm still working on: (i) producing the parental labor income forecasts (full life-cycle); (ii) updating the labor income forecast to account for dynamics; (iii) provide a sensitivity analysis to the variables used to forecast. These three should be ready soon.\\

\noindent I'm also sending to you treatment effects interacted with the risk index for three outcomes of interest (as a first exercise). I believe the sample is too small for this approach to be promising.\\

\noindent Thanks, 
\noindent Jorge
