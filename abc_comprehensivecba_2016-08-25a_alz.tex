\begin{abstract}
This paper estimates the diverse array of life cycle benefits of an influential early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children and their families. The program is a prototype for numerous interventions in place around the world. It has substantial beneficial long-term effects on (a) health and the quality of life, (b) the earnings of participants, (c) the earnings of their mothers through subsidizing childcare, (d) crime, and (e) education. Benefits differ by gender. There are more substantial monetized benefits for boys. The overall rate of return is a statistically significant 13\% per annum with a benefit/cost ratio of 5.6, even after accounting for the welfare costs of taxation to finance the intervention. Estimates are robust to a variety of sensitivity analyses.

\section{Introduction}

This paper documents the diverse array of life cycle benefits of an influential intensive early childhood program targeted to disadvantaged children that starts in the first weeks of life. Different ways of characterizing the numerous benefits of the program all agree that the program has a substantial impact on the lives of participants. Monetizing benefits and costs across multiple domains produces policy-relevant and economically interpretable summaries of the program. It has a rate of return of 13\% per annum and a benefit/cost ratio of 5.6. There are substantial differences in benefits across genders.

This analysis contributes to a growing literature on the benefits of early interventions for disadvantaged children.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Currie_2011_AER} and \cite{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}.} Long-term evidence on their effectiveness is surprisingly limited.\footnote{The major source of evidence is from the Perry Preschool Program (see \citealp{Schweinhart_Montie_ea_2005_BOOKlifetime} and \citealp{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn,Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}), the ABC/CARE programs (\citealp{Ramey_Campbell_etal_2000_ADS,Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}), and IHDP (\citealp{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth,Duncan_Sojourner_2013_JHR}). IHDP was inspired by ABC/CARE \citep[][]{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth}.} For want of long-term followup data, many studies of early childhood interventions report outcomes at early ages. Moreover, many of the available studies use only a limited set of outcomes like IQ or scores on school readiness measures.\footnote{See, e.g., \cite{Kline_Walters_2014_EvaluatingPublicPrograms} and \cite{Weiland_2013_CD_Impacts-of-Pre-K}.} Yet it is the long-term costs and benefits across multiple domains of life achievement that are relevant to policy analysis.

We present an array of \emph{long-term} benefits from two virtually identical early childhood interventions implemented in North Carolina and evaluated using random assignment. The programs are the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE), henceforth ABC/CARE. They were launched in the early 1970s and have long-term follow-ups through age 34. We analyze their impacts on a variety of life-relevant outcomes such as health, the quality of life, participation in crime, earnings, IQ, schooling, and the increase in mother's employment arising from program subsidies to childcare.

The program starts early (at 8 weeks) and engages participants to age 5. Evidence from these programs is relevant for today's policy discussions because their main features are present in a variety of programs currently in place around the world.\footnote{Programs inspired by ABC/CARE have been (and are being) launched around the world. \citet{Sparling_2010_Highlights} and \citet{Ramey_Ramey_Lanzi_2014_Interventions} list numerous programs based on ABC/CARE. The names of the programs with years launched and locations in parentheses are: IHDP---eight different cities around the U.S. \citep{Spiker-etal_1997_Helping}; Early Head Start and Head Start in the U.S. \citep{Schneider_McDonald-eds_2007_Scale-Up_Vol-1}; John's Hopkins Cerebral Palsy Study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; CLIO study in the U.S. \citep{Sparling_2010_Highlights}; Massachusetts Family Child Care Study \citep{Collins_etal_2010_Massachusetts-Study}; Healthy Child Manitoba Evaluation \citep{Healthy_Child_Manitoba_2015_Starting-Early}; Abecedarian Approach within an Innovative Implementation Framework \citep{Jensen_Nielsen_2016_ABC-Programme-Pilot}; and Building a Bridge into Preschool in Remote Northern Territory Communities in Australia \citep{UMonash_Dataset_2015_URL}. Educare programs are based on ABC/CARE \citep{Educare_2014_Research_Agenda,Yazejian_Bryant_2012_Educare}.} The population targeted by the program still exists: roughly 19\% of all African-American children would be eligible for the program today.\footnote{43\% of African American children were eligible in 1972 \citep{Garcia_2016_National-Implementation-ECI}.}

Summarizing the benefits of a program with a diverse array of outcomes across many domains and periods of life is both challenging and rewarding. Doing so highlights the numerous channels through which early childhood programs enhance capabilities. We use a variety of methodologies to characterize program benefits. Instead of just reporting individual treatment effects by category, our benefit/cost analysis accounts for all program components, including the welfare cost of taxes to publicly finance these programs.\footnote{\cite{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} present a cost/benefit analysis for ABC for outcomes through age 21, before many benefits are realized. They report a benefit/cost ratio of 2.5, but give no standard error for their estimate. They do not disaggregate by gender. For want of the data collected on health at age 34, they do not account for health benefits. They use self-reported crime data (unlike the police record data later collected that we analyze) and ignore the welfare costs of financing the program. We use cost data from a variety of primary sources not available to them.}

A fundamental problem facing the evaluation of any human capital intervention is assessing future benefits of the program not yet surveyed.\footnote{\cite{Mincer_1974_schooling} addresses this problem using a synthetic cohort approach. See \cite{Heckman_Lochner_ea_2006_HEE}.} We address this problem by combining information from multiple panel data sources to project benefits and costs over the lifetimes of participants.\footnote{See, e.g., \citet{Ridder_Moffitt_2007_hbk_metricsdata} for a valuable discussion of data pooling methods.} We account for sampling uncertainty from pooling data and conduct sensitivity analyses of components for which sampling uncertainty is not readily quantified. Our approach to pooling multiple data sets and analyzing blocks of outcomes is of interest in its own right as a template for evaluating other programs with numerous outcomes, although this paper is not primarily methodological in character.

We add to the literature on evaluating early childhood programs by considering long-run benefits on health. We estimate the savings in life cycle medical costs and improvements on the quality of life.\footnote{\cite{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} show the substantial adult (age 34) health benefits of ABC but do not present a cost/benefit analysis of their results.} We also find substantial childcare benefits that promote the work of mothers of participating children. There are substantial life cycle benefits in terms of reduced crime, gains in life cycle earnings, reduced special education costs, and enhanced educational attainment.

Figure~\ref{figure:npvsall} summarizes the main findings of the paper. It displays the discounted life cycle program costs and benefits for male and female participants: costs are substantial, as has frequently been noted in public policy discussions.\footnote{\cite{Whitehurst_2014_Senate_Testimony}.} But so are benefits.

Note: This figure displays the life-cycle net present values of the main components of the cost-benefit analysis of ABC/CARE discounted to birth at a rate of 3\%.  By ``net" we mean that each component represents the total value for the treatment group minus the total value for the control group. Program costs refers to the total cost of implementing ABC/CARE. Total net benefits represents the total net benefits of \textit{all} the components we consider. Labor income represents total individual labor income from ages 20 to the retirement of program participants. Parental income represents total parental labor income of the parents of the program participants from when the participants were ages 0 to 15. Crime is the total cost of crime (judiciary and victimization costs). Total medical costs accounts for both private and public medical costs from ages 15 to 79. Costs of education represent the total costs of education of the individual from ages 6 to 26 and include any costs from special education and grade retention.
*QALYs refers to the quality-adjusted life years gain due to better health conditions through age 79.\\}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

The rest of the paper justifies and interprets this figure. We proceed in the following way. Section~\ref{section:background} discusses main features of ABC/CARE. Section~\ref{section:methodology} discusses the methodological challenges faced in evaluating the program.

There are many outcomes measured across multiple stages of the life cycle that summarize the multiple benefits of the program. We use three main methodologies: (a) step down multiple hypothesis testing procedures following \cite{Romano_Wolf_2005_JASA}, reporting blocks of outcomes and adjusting $p$-values for the multiplicity of reported outcomes to avoid cherry-picking of ``significant'' results\footnote{For an application, see, e.g., \citealp{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_QE}.}; (b) combining functions that summarize the \emph{number} of beneficial outcomes (as well as the number of statistically significant beneficial outcomes) within blocks of outcomes and overall. This gives a convenient summary of the mass of evidence in favor of program effects. Our principal tool is (c), cost/benefit and rate of return analysis, which monetizes the costs and benefits associated with outcomes. We also disaggregate benefits by the categories depicted in Figure~\ref{figure:npvsall}.

Another methodological challenge is control group substitution bias.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_1992_randomization}, \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE}, and \cite{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}.} Roughly 70\% of our experimental control groups take some form of alternative preschool at least some of the time. We define and estimate counterfactuals corresponding to (i) treatment versus taking the next best option, (ii) treatment versus staying at home, and (iii) treatment versus attending an alternative preschool.

Section~\ref{section:results} reports and discusses our estimates. Estimates from different approaches agree. There are substantial benefits that differ by gender. Women benefit across more domains measured in terms of treatment effects. However, the monetized value of the positive treatment effects is greater for men. This is largely driven by the health benefits and reduction in crime for males. Section~\ref{section:conclusion} concludes.

\section[Background and Data Sources]{Background and Data Sources} \label{section:background}

\subsection{Overview}

ABC/CARE targeted disadvantaged children in Chapel Hill/Durham, North Carolina.\footnote{Both programs were designed and implemented by researchers at the Frank Porter Graham Center of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.} Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison} presents an overview and compares the two programs. In the text, we summarize their main features. Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} describes these programs in detail. The goals of the interventions were to enhance the early-life skills of a disadvantaged population. The intervention (i) supported language, motor, and cognitive development; (ii) minimized high-risk behaviors; and (iii) developed socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task-orientation, communicative competence, independence, and pro-social behavior.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.}

The program provided individualized treatment. Infant caregivers recorded each child's progress and appropriately adapted learning activities every 2 to 3 weeks. Environments were organized to promote pre-literacy and access to a rich set of learning tools.\footnote{The ``Learningames'' approach was implemented by infant and toddler caregivers in 1:1 child-adult interactions. Each ``Learningames'' activity stated a developmentally-appropriate objective, the necessary materials, directions for teacher behavior, and expected child outcome.} The curriculum emphasized active learning experiences, dramatic play, and basic ideas of order and category (pre-academic skills), as well as disciple and the ability to interact with and respect others.  At later ages (3 through 5), the program became increasingly structured, focusing on the development of pre-academic skills and ``socio-linguistic and communicative competence.''\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Haskins_1985_CD, Ramey_1981_Modification, Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree,Sparling_Lewis_1984_BOOKLearningGamesThreesFours}.}

\end{center}

ABC recruited four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1976. CARE recruited two cohorts of children, born in 1978 and 1979. The recruitment processes for each study were identical. Potential participant families were referred to researchers by local social service agencies and hospitals at the beginning of the mother's last trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility was determined by a score of 11 or above on a High-risk Index (HRI).\footnote{Examples of variables in the HRI are maternal education and father's stability at work. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for details on the construction of the HRI.}

The design and implementation of both programs were similar. ABC had two phases, the first of which lasted from birth until age 5. In this phase, children were randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. The treatment group received: (i) center-based childcare; (ii) breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, iron-fortified formula for the first 15 months of life, and diapers until age 3; and (iii) medical care from licensed nurses who were supervised by a pediatrician, frequent health check-ups, and hospital referrals when serious medical treatment was needed. In contrast, the control group only received iron-fortified formula for the first 15 months and diapers until age 3. In the second phase of treatment, at the age of 5, the 95 subjects still in the study were randomly assigned again to treatment or control groups, independently of their status in the prior randomization. This second-phase treatment consisted of home visits targeting both children and parents and lasted until age 8.

CARE also has two treatment phases, although subjects were only randomized initially. While the two programs have essentially identical second phases, the first phase of CARE differed from the first phase of ABC by its inclusion of a family education arm. This arm was designed to study the effects of improving the home environment on child development.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} The first treatment phase of CARE lasted from birth until age 5. Children were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: control (23 children), family education (27 children), and both family education and center-based childcare (17 children). As in ABC, the control group received iron-fortified formula from birth to 15 months and diapers to age 3. The family education group received home visits that aimed to help parents solve common problems related to childrearing. Both treatment groups received the second phase of treatment from ages 5 to 8. The ABC and CARE programs shared many program characteristics, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison}.

We only use the groups in the CARE sample that received the ABC curriculum. We only consider the intervention through age 5. The family education components of ABC had no effects.\footnote{See \citealp{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}. \citet{ABCCARE_Dataset} show that there is no effect of the family education component alone.}

We describe the main components of the core of the treatment offered in the center in the next few paragraphs and refer to the interested reader to Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} for more details on this part of the treatment, as well as other complementary features and activities.

For both programs, from birth until the age of 8, data were collected annually on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, home environment, family structure, and family economic characteristics. After age 8, data on cognitive and socio-emotional skills, education, and family economic characteristics were collected at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30.\footnote{At age 30, measures of cognitive skills are unavailable for both ABC and CARE.} In addition, we have unique administrative criminal records and a full medical survey at age 34. This allows us to study the long-term effects of the programs along multiple dimensions of human development. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:data} for a more comprehensive description of the data.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:randomization}, we document the balance in observed baseline characteristics across the treatment and control groups, once we drop the individuals for whom we have crime or health information, for which there is substantial attrition. Further, the methodology we propose addresses missing information in either of these two outcome categories.}

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises} \label{section:randomization}

\subsubsection{ABC}

Both the first and second phases of randomization were conducted at the family level, so pairs of siblings and twins were jointly randomized into either treatment or control groups.\footnote{Sibling pairs occurred when the two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that pairing was based on HRI, maternal IQ, maternal education, maternal age, and gender of the subject, we do not know the original pairs. The study collected an initial sample of 122 subjects. 22 subjects did not complete the first-phase of treatment as initially assigned by the randomization. We characterize each of the cases in Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} and document that our estimates are robust when we adjust for missing data using the methods discussed in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:controls}, we compare the observed, baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} to the observed, baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.}


\subsection{Control Group Substitution}

In both programs, many control group subjects attend alternative preschools.\footnote{See \cite{Heckman_Hohmann_etal_2000_QJE} on the issue of substitution bias on social experiments.} In ABC, \treatsubsabc\ of control-group subjects were enrolled in one of 11 local center-based childcare centers. Most of these centers received federal subsidies and were regulated by the Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements. Their staff members were required to be trained in early childhood education, and the centers were required to implement approved curricula designed to enhance cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children. They had to comply to stringent staff-child ratios.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev}.} In CARE, \treatsubscarec\ of the control group and \treatsubscaref\ of the family education group were enrolled in alternative preschools by their parents (see Figure~\ref{tab:programcomparison}). Parents in both of these groups had as options a similar set of local center-based childcare centers as the ABC children in the control group. We document this more thoroughly in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background}. Families of the participants in the control group selected into different intensities of alternative preschool. 

Figure~\ref{fig:enrollment-alt-pre} shows that although over 80\% of children were enrolled in alternative preschool starting at age 2, it is not until the children are older (age 3) the average number of months enrolled increases. Across all 5 years, most children are enrolled 60\% of the time (Figure~\ref{fig:proportion-alt-pre}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Program Costs} \label{section:programscosts}

Costs are a fundamental component to the benefit-to-cost ratios and the internal rate of returns. We improve on previous estimates of the costs by using primary-source documentation.\footnote{These are progress reports written by the principal investigators and related documentation recovered in the archives of the research center where the program was implemented. We display these sources in Appendix \ref{app:programcosts}.}

Table~\ref{tab:totalcosts} breaks down costs by different categories for a year of treatment. We obtain the personnel wages from the primary sources we show in Appendix \ref{app:programcosts} and include the type of personnel based on conversations with the programs' staff. We adjust wages upward by 15\% to the wages to account for fringe benefits. The costs we label as ``other'' arise from nutrition and services that the subjects receive when they are sick, diapers during the first 15 months of their lives, and transportation to the center.\footnote{The control children also received diapers during approximately 15 months, and iron-fortified formula. We assume that this generated a cost of half that amounts to half of ``other'' category for the first 15 months of their lives.} The costs are based on sources describing ABC treatment for $52$ children.\footnote{We use the same costs estimates for the comparable CARE, for which information is less available.}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{threeparttable}
\caption{Yearly Program Costs, ABC and CARE} \label{tab:totalcosts}
\footnotesize
\input{output/programcosts}
\begin{tablenotes}
\footnotesize
\item Sources: See Appendix~\ref{app:programcosts}.\\
\item Note: This table summarizes the yearly costs for ABC and CARE. They are based on primary-source documentation describing ABC. We assume that the costs for ABC and CARE were the same based on conversations with programs' staff \citet{projectcare2014interviews,abc2014-2015interviews}.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

The costs exclude any research-related or policy-analyses expenses. Our calculation is $\$295,239$ (1979 USD).\footnote{An independent calculation reported by the program implemented indicates that the yearly cost of the program was $\$275,475$  (1979 USD).}

\subsection{Non-experimental Data Sources}

Our cost-benefit analysis requires (i) \textit{interpolation} of components we do not observe due to intermittent data collection; and (ii) \textit{extrapolation} or forecasting of components we do not observe because the follow-ups stop when the subjects were in their mid-30s. We use multiple sources of non-experimental data representative on the national or state level to construct these interpolations and extrapolations. Table~\ref{table:sources} details the components for which we do these exercises and the sources we use. Section~\ref{section:methodology} explains our methodology for doing so.

Random assignment to treatment alone does not guarantee that conventional treatment-effect estimates commonly used in the literature are able to answer policy-relevant questions.\footnote{Although ABC/CARE is criticized for its small sample size (see Charles Murray's commentary in \citealp
{Heckman_2013_BOOKGivingkidsfair}), \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments} show that asymptotic inference is valid in the ABC sample. Therefore, we do not report results from small-sample methods such as permutation testing. We can reproduce these results for interested readers.} For an estimator to be useful in policy design, it should relate to a relevant parameter by clearly stating the counterfactual scenario to which the evaluated program is being compared. We define three parameters and link them to different policy questions.

Let $Y$ denote an outcome of interest. $D$ indicates whether or not the parents of the subject agree to participate of the program and $R | D = 1$ denotes randomization to either treatment or control status; $T$ denotes the number of periods during the first phase of treatment---5 years.\footnote{We define parameters that are conditional on the parents agreeing to participate of the program. That is, conditional on $D = 1$. We find little sensitivity to the few cases of non-compliance in Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} and adjust our estimates for the cases of attrition as we explain in Appendix~\ref{appendix:attrition}.} We think of two counterfactuals under control status:
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_H^0 \left( t, \omega \right) &:& \textbf{ Outcome under control status; subject stays at home in period $t$} \nonumber \\
Y_C^0 \left( t, \omega \right) &:& \textbf{ Outcome under control status; subject attends preschool in period $t$}  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

We define the proportion of months in alternative preschool as
\begin{equation}
V \left ( \omega \right) : = \frac{\# \{ t: Y_H^0 \left( t, \omega \right) - Y_C^0 \left( t, \omega \right) \leq 0 \} }{T}.
\end{equation}

Describing the dynamic choices underlying $V \left ( \omega \right)$ is of interest but goes beyond the scope of this paper. We simplify the analysis by assuming that timing is irrelevant:
\begin{align}
Y_H^0 \left( t, \omega \right) &= Y_H^0 \left( \omega \right) \nonumber \\
Y_C^0 \left( t, \omega \right) &= Y_C^0 \left( \omega \right).
\end{align}
\textbf{[JJH: All programs alike]} The counterfactual outcome when the child is in control status is
\begin{equation}
Y^0 \left( \omega \right) : = \left[ 1 - V \left( \omega \right) \right] Y_H^0 \left( \omega \right) + \left[ V \left( \omega \right) \right] Y_C^0 \left( \omega \right),
\end{equation}
and make explicit its dependence on $V \left( \omega \right)$, allowing us to answer policy-relevant questions. Likewise, we write the outcome when the child is fixed to treatment status as $Y^1 \left( \omega \right)$.

There are two possible approaches. One approach is to treat $V \left( \omega \right)$ as binary, where $V \left( \omega \right) = 0$ or $V \left( \omega \right)  > 0$. The other approach is to allow for multiple values of $V$ and let $V$ to be continuous in the limit. The latter approach is ideal, because it would allow us to construct the counterfactual $Y_C^0 \left( V,  \omega \right) $ for $V \in [0 , 1]$ denoting a realization of $V$. This approach, however, is problematic in the context of the small number of observations in our experimental datasets. While the former approach limits the cases to either $V \left( \omega \right) = 0$ or $V \left( \omega \right)  > 0$, it still allows for the definition of policy-relevant parameters. Under this approach, we can frame the parental decision in a standard Roy-type setting. Given $U(.)$ as the utility associated with ``." we note that

\begin{equation}
\Pr \left[ U \left(Y^1 \left( \omega \right)\right) \geq \left\{ \max U \left(  Y_{H}^0 \left( \omega \right)\right) ,  U\left(Y_{C}^0 \left( \omega \right)   \right) \right\} \vert D =  1\right] = 1.
\label{eq:noutility}
\end{equation}

We present estimates for different versions of this Roy model in Appendix~\ref{appendix:amethodology}.

We focus on simpler parameters that we can directly use in the cost-benefit analysis. The estimates of these parameters and the Roy-model equivalents are qualitatively similar. The first parameter of interest relates to the following question: what is the effect of the program as implemented? That is, what is the effect of the program without fixing the parental decision of whether or not to enroll the subject in alternative preschool? Importantly, this parameter does not speak to the effectiveness of the program by itself. Instead, it speaks to the effectiveness of the program relative to the supply of alternatives preschools that was in place when the program was implemented. The parameter is:

\begin{equation}
\Delta := \mathbb{E}_{\Omega} \left[ Y^1 \left( \omega \right) -  \max \left(  Y_{H}^0 \left( \omega \right) ,  Y_{C}^0 \left( \omega \right)  \right) | D =1 \right]. \label{eq:mainest}
\end{equation}

Random assignment to either the treatment or control group allows us to identify this parameter.

It is perhaps more policy-relevant to inquire on the efficiency of a program with respect to a clearly stated counterfactual. For example, if we ask: what is the effectiveness of the program with respect to a counterfactual in which the child stays at home? The parameter associated with this question is:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \left(V = 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E}_{\Omega} \left[ Y^1 \left( V, \omega \right) - Y^0 \left( V, \omega \right) | V = 0, D = 1 \right]. \label{eq:par0}
\end{equation}

Random assignment to the treatment group does not directly identify this parameter.\footnote{We abuse notation to index the realization of $V \left( \omega \right)$. Differently from the definition above, the first argument in $Y^r \left( \cdot, \cdot \right)$ represents the proportion of time in preschool alternatives and not a time period. We do this to avoid further complicating the indices of the counterfactual outcomes.} We can approximate it with the following estimator: \textbf{[JJH: Confuses estimator]}
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\Delta} \left(V = 0 \right) : = \widehat{\mathbf{E}} \left[ Y | R = 1, V \in \left[ 0 , \eta \right], D = 1 \right] - \widehat{\mathbf{E}} \left[ Y | R = 0, V \in \left[ 0 , \eta \right], D = 1 \right] \label{eq:estimates0}
\end{equation}
with $\eta \rightarrow 0$ and where $\widehat{\mathbf{E}}[\cdot]$ represents an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$. That is, we compare the subjects randomly assigned to treatment with the subjects randomly assigned to control in a neighborhood where subjects do not take preschool alternatives. Various matching estimators allow us to estimate how likely subjects are to take preschool alternatives, based on observed characteristics \citep{Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1997_REStud,Heckman_Ichimura_etal_1998_REStud}. We provide different versions of these estimators below.

Similarly, we define a parameter that allows us to compare the effectiveness of the program relative to the preschool alternatives:
\begin{equation}
\Delta \left( v > 0 \right) : =   \mathbb{E}_{\Omega} \left[ Y^1 \left( v, \omega \right) - Y^0 \left( v, \omega \right) | V > 0, D = 1 \right] \label{eq:par1}
\end{equation}
and provide an estimate analogous to \eqref{eq:estimates0}. The parameters in \eqref{eq:par0} and \eqref{eq:par1} address control substitution, in the sense that they fix the counterfactual comparison accounting for the decisions that the parents make to enroll children in alternative preschools.

\subsection{Testing Multiple Hypotheses}  \label{section:counts}

We are interested in the effects that the program has on multiple dimensions of human development. We have measures of outcomes from very early in life to the mid-30s. This generates a multiple hypothesis testing problem. Two approaches are: (i) adjust the inference to account for the correlation of the outcomes using a step-down procedure \citep{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat,Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}; and (ii) monetize the outcomes to produce a cost-benefit analysis. We adjust the inference when estimating the parameters in Section~\ref{section:methodsquestions} as in \citet{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat} and \citet{Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat} and provide a cost-benefit analysis below. In this section, we provide an intermediate alternative that informs on the relative importance of different outcomes in the cost-benefit analysis.

Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the index set for different groups of outcomes and let $\mathcal{O}^{g}$ be a group of outcomes, with $g \in \mathcal{G}$. Let $F_{j,g}^r \left( y_{j,g}^r \right) $ be the marginal distribution of outcome $j$ in group $g$ and $r \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$, where $R = r$ denotes treatment status. Assume that we want to perform inference on estimates of parameters of the type \eqref{eq:mainest} across multiple outcomes. That is, inference on

\begin{equation}
\Delta_{j,g} := \mathbb{E}_{\Omega} \left[ Y_{j,g}^1 \left( \omega \right) -  \max \left(  Y_{j,g,H}^0 \left( \omega \right) ,  Y_{j,g,C}^0 \left( \omega \right)  \right) | D =1 \right].
\end{equation}
for the group of outcomes in $\mathcal{O}^{g}$. We want to test the null hypothesis
\begin{equation}
H_{0} : F_{j,g}^0 = F_{j,g}^1, \ \forall \ j \in \mathcal{O}^{g}.
\end{equation}

In practice, we test the hypothesis
\begin{equation}
H_{0} : \Delta_{j,g} = 0, \ \forall \ j \in \mathcal{O}^{g}.
\end{equation}

We use the following statistic to test this hypothesis:
\begin{equation}
T_{g} = \sum _{j=1}^{\# \mathcal{O}^g} \mathbf{1} \left[ \widehat{\Delta}_{j,g} > 0\right]. \label{eq:count}
\end{equation}

For inference purposes, we bootstrap this procedure and construct a null distribution. The $p$-value for the number of socially positive treatment effects in group $g$ is $1 - \widehat{F}_{g} \left( T_{g} \right)$, where $ \widehat{F}_{g}$ is the empirical bootstrap distribution of group $g$.\footnote{For the case where we count the number of positive and significant outcomes, we use a ``double bootstrap'' to produce an inference on the count. We resample $B_{0}$ times to obtain the $p$-value for testing the hypothesis of interest for each individual outcome. This allows us to compute the number of positive and significant treatment effects, for example. We repeat this procedure $B_{1}$ times to obtain a distribution for this count. Thus, the double bootstrap consists of $B_{0} \times B_{1}$ data resamplings.}

A particular case is to count the positive treatment effects in the outcomes across all the groups indexed in the set $\mathcal{G}$. This allows us to avoid (i) arbitrarily picking outcomes that have statistically significant effects---``cherry picking''; or (ii) arbitrarily blocking sets of outcomes to correct the $p$-values when accounting for multiple hypothesis testing.

We provide inference on this count and on a count of treatment effects that are both positive and significant for which the inference is analogous. We also provide counts for the parameters that account for control substitution.

\subsection{Forecasting and Monetizing Life-cycle Costs and Benefits} \label{section:cbamethodology}

\noindent In this section, we explain our strategy to interpolate and extrapolate the life-cycle costs and benefits of education, labor income, crime, and health. The methodology for doing this exercise for parental and public-transfer income is analogous to that of labor income so we suppress it for brevity. More methodological and practical details are in Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}, in which we also explain a solution for cases of attrition when producing interpolations and extrapolations. Based on our forecasts, we estimate the parameters in Section~\ref{section:methodsquestions} to perform the cost-benefit analysis of the program with and without accounting for control substitution.

\subsubsection{Education}

Follow-up data on educational attainment were collected up to age 30, on average. In Appendix \ref{appendix:education}, we show that education up to this age is an accurate portrayal of lifetime educational attainment. Therefore, we do not actually forecast beyond age 30. To monetize the costs of education, we consider the public cost of K-12 education, and the private costs of post-secondary education (including enrollment in vocational programs and community college). Other costs of education include grade retention and special education costs.

\subsubsection{Labor Income}

\noindent We observe labor income at ages 21 and 30. To construct a life-cycle profile, we interpolate between ages 21 and 30 and extrapolate from ages 31 to 67, in which we assume that the subjects retire. For simplicity, we suppress $D$ and drop individual and time subscripts. Recall that $R$ indicates whether the subject was randomized to the treatment group ($R=1$) or to the control group ($R=0$), conditional on having agreed to participate in the program ($D = 1$). $Y$ is the outcome for which we want to produce a forecast---interpolation or extrapolation. In this case, the outcome is labor income. $X$ is a vector of observed characteristics, possibly affected by the treatment---e.g. lagged values of $Y$; $W$ is a vector of baseline characteristics---e.g. race and gender; $S$ indicates whether we observe $Y$ in the experimental sample ($S=1$) or an auxiliary, non-experimental data source ($S=0$).\\

\noindent Our objective is to recover a forecast for $Y$ of the type

\begin{equation}
\widehat{Y} = \widehat{\phi} \left( R, X, W, S = 1 \right) + \widehat{\varepsilon},   \label{eq:additive}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi \left( R, X, W, S \right) : = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = s \right] $ and $\widehat{\varepsilon}$ is a forecasting error. That is, we assume that the outcome of interest is an additively separable function of the known objects $R, X, W, S$ and an unobserved component $\varepsilon$:

\begin{assumption} (Additive Separability of the Outcome) \label{ass:additive}
\begin{equation}
Y = \phi \left( R, X, W, S \right) + \varepsilon.
\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\noindent Identifying $\phi \left( R, X, W, S \right)$ requires three assumptions. First, the forecast is based on observed characteristics, $X$. Thus, we require the auxiliary datasets to share the support on observed characteristics with the experimental dataset:

\begin{assumption} \label{ass:support} (Common Support Between the Experimental and Auxiliary Datasets)
\begin{equation}
\sup \left( X | S = 1 \right) \subseteq \sup \left( X | S = 0 \right).
\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\noindent Second, we assume that we are able to summarize the impacts that the treatment has on the outcomes with observed characteristics, given that we are not able to observe $R$ in the auxiliary dataset. Similarly, we need to be able to summarize the difference between the individuals in the experimental datasets and those in the auxiliary datasets based on observed characteristics. This is the third assumption. The second and third  assumptions are related, as they establish the requirements for being able to ``link'' the individuals in the auxiliary and experimental datasets when producing the forecasts. Formally, let $^{*}$ denote variables we do not observe. In the auxiliary dataset we have: $\left( S = 0, Y, X, W, R^* \right)$. In the experimental dataset we have: $\left( S = 1, Y^*, X, W, R \right)$. The second and third assumptions are:

\begin{assumption} (Conditional Independence and Sufficiency of $S, X, W$ to Describe Treatment)
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = s\right] =  \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = s\right]
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x^r$ is a draw from the distribution of $X | R = r$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption} (Conditional Independence and Sufficiency of $X, W, R$ to Describe Presence in a Dataset)
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[ Y^* | R = r, X = x, W = w, S = 1 \right] = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R^* = r , X = x, W = w, S = 0\right].
\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\noindent These three assumptions imply that

\begin{equation}
\phi \left( R, X, W, S = 1 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]$ is a moment in the auxiliary dataset. The estimation of $\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | X = x^r, W = w, S = 0 \right]$ produces a residual of the form $\widehat{\varepsilon} : = Y - \widehat{Y}$ for each individual. The forecast for each  individual outcome consists of $\widehat{\phi} \left( \cdot \right)$ and a draw from the empirical distribution of $\widehat{\varepsilon}$, which we call forecast error. We account for it when interpolating and extrapolating the crime and health outcomes in addition to income.

\subsubsection{Crime}  \label{sec:crime}

In this section, we explain how we quantify the benefits of the program from reductions in the subject's criminal activity. Two previous studies consider the impacts of ABC on crime: \citet{Clarke_Campbell_1998_ABC_Comparison_ECRQ} use administrative crime records up to age 21, and find no significant differences between the treatment and the control groups. \cite{Barnett_Masse_2007_EER} mention crime in their cost-benefit analysis, but they cite the previous study to claim that there are no savings coming from a reduction in crime. We consider richer data than the previous studies, which allows us to consider crime with a comprehensive life-cycle perspective: we gather various data sources, including administrative data on individual criminal records up to age 34, and project crimes until age 50 using prediction models based on local microdata.

We consider the following types of crime: arson, assault, burglary, fraud, larceny, miscellaneous (which includes traffic and non-violent drug crimes), murder, vehicle theft, rape, robbery, and vandalism. We use data from: (i) administrative youth arrests datasets, gathered for the age-21 follow-up; (ii) administrative adult arrests datasets, gathered around age 34; (iii) administrative sentences datasets, gathered around age 34; and (iv) self-reported adult crimes datasets, gathered in the age-21 and age-30 subject interviews. Because none of these data sources capture all criminal activity, it is necessary to combine them to more completely approximate the crimes the subjects committed. These datasets are discussed more extensively in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}. The data are comprehensive and cover the full potential criminal career of subjects up to age 34, including details on the types of crimes and their timing, as well as projected and effective sentences.

We use several auxiliary datasets to construct national arrests-to-sentences and victims-to-arrests ratios: (i) the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to estimate the number of victims of crime; (ii) the National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) to estimate the number of sentences; and (iii) the Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics (UCRS) to estimate the number of arrests. Finally, we use microdata from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (NCDPS) to estimate a prediction model for future crimes. This dataset contains information since 1972 on every individual who was convicted of a crime and entered the state prison system.

We follow four steps to estimate the costs of crime. We summarize the steps here and present a broader discussion in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Count arrests and sentences.} We start by counting the total number of sentences for each individual and type of crime (robbery, larceny, etc.) up to age 34. Then, we match the data on adult arrests, juvenile arrests, and self-reported crimes, to construct the total number of  arrests for each individual and type of crime up to that age.\footnote{In practice, we count all offenses (an arrest might include multiple offenses). This gives the correct number of victims for our estimations. The youth data have coarser categories than the rest of the data, so we assume that all property crimes were larcenies and that all violent crimes are assaults. In our sample, assault is the most common type of violent crime, and larceny/theft is the most common property crime.} About 10\% of the ABC and CARE samples have missing arrest data. For these cases, we impute the number of arrests by multiplying the number of sentences for each type of crime by the  national arrests-to-sentences ratio for the respective crime.
\item \textit{Construct predictions.} Based on the sentences observed before age 34, we predict the sentences that the ABC and CARE subjects will have after that age. The NCDPS data provide lifetime sentences of individuals in North Carolina, the same state in which the program was implemented. In that dataset, we estimate linear prediction models for each type of crime in which sentences after age 34 are the outcomes, and sentences up to age 34 are the regressors. Then, we apply these models to the ABC and CARE data. The outcome for each crime type is the number of future sentences for each subject, up to age 50. We assume that individuals with no criminal records before age 34 commit no crimes after age 34. We then add these estimates to the original number of sentences, getting an estimate of the lifetime sentences. To the best of our knowledge, no prior study on the benefits and costs of an educational program has used microdata to estimate a predictive model for future crimes. The predictions are an important component of total crime, as adding them increases the total count of crimes by 30\%--50\%. The prediction models we estimate and the results in terms of additional crimes are presented in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}.
\item \textit{Estimate number of victims of crimes.} We observe crimes that resulted in consequences in the judicial system (i.e. crimes that resulted in arrests, sentences, or both). However, it is possible that for any subject for whom we observe to have committed a crime, he committed more crimes that we do not observe. Victimization inflation (VI) is a method to capture benefits of crime reduction for crimes without consequences in the judicial system that are unobserved in the ABC and CARE data. Previous papers using this method include \citet{Belfield_Nores_etal_2006_JHR} and \cite{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}. We start by constructing a VI ratio, which is the national ratio of victims-to-arrests for each type of crime.\footnote{We assume that each crime with victims is counted separately in the national reports on arrests, even for arrests that might have been motivated by more than one crime.} Then, we estimate the number of victims for each type of crime committed by ABC and CARE subjects as their total arrests multiplied by the VI ratio. Additionally, we can calculate an analogous estimate of the number of crime victims using sentences, based on the VI ratio and the national arrests-to-sentences ratio. Both estimates are very similar, as shown in Appendix \ref{appendix:crime}. To improve precision, the estimates in the rest of our paper are based on the average of the two.
\item \textit{Find total costs of crimes.} We use the estimates of the cost of crimes for victims from \cite{McCollister_etal_2010_DAD} to impute the total victimization costs (see Appendix \ref{appendix:crime} for details on the costs we use). For crimes having arrests, sentences, or both, we consider judicial system costs as well, such as police costs.\footnote{To be able to assign costs to each type of crime, we assume that the cost of the justice system depends on the number of offenses of each type, rather than on the number of arrests. While this could very slightly overestimate justice system costs, the costs only represent about 5\% of the total crime costs.} Finally, we construct the total costs of incarceration for each subject using the total prison time and the cost of a day in prison.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Health} \label{section:health}

We use an alternative methodology for health-related outcomes. There are three main reasons for this: (i) health outcomes such as diabetes or heart disease are absorbing states; (ii) health outcomes are highly interdependent within and across time; and (iii) there is no evident time period available to finish accounting for benefits and costs. For example, for income we extrapolate up to the retirement age of 67. However, for health, we need to predict an age of death for each individual. Thus, using the notation so far, it is not sufficient to condition on $W, Z, X$ to recover a credible estimate of the treatment effect. Instead, we use an adaptation of the Future America Model (FAM) that projects health outcomes from the subjects' early- to mid-30s up to their projected death \citep{Goldman_etal_2015_Future-Elderly-Model-Report}.\footnote{The simulation starts at the age in which we observe the subject's age-34 health follow-up. On average this happened at age 34 for both males and females, but there is variation ranging from age 30 to age 37.}

We provide a brief description of the model in this subsection. Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} provides a thorough discussion. The methodology has six steps: (i) estimate the age-by-age health state transition probabilities using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID); (ii) match these transition probabilities to the ABC and CARE individuals based on observed characteristics; (iii) estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) models using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the PSID; (iv) estimate medical cost models using the MEPS and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), allowing estimates to differ by health state and observed characteristics; and (v) predict the medical expenditure and QALYs that correspond to the simulated individual health trajectories.\footnote{As an intermediate step between (i) and (ii), we impute some of the variables used to initialize the FAM models (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:health})}.

Our microsimulation model starts the health predictions at age 30, with the information on observed characteristics available at this age. We restrict it to the individuals for whom we have information from the age-34 health follow-up. This allows us to account for components that are crucial for predicting health outcomes, such as the body mass index (BMI). The models predict the probability of being in any of the states in the horizontal axis of Table~\ref{table:transition} at age $a+1$ based on the state at age $a$, which is described by the vertical axis of the table. The crosses indicate if being in a health a state at age $a$ is relevant for the estimation of the probability of being in a health state at age $a + 1$.\footnote{In practice, the predictions are based on two-year lags, due to data limitations in the auxiliary sources we use to simulate the FAM. For example, if the individual is 30 (31) years old in the age-30 interview, we simulate the trajectory of her health status at ages 30 (31), 32 (33), 34 (35), and so on until her projected dead.} Absorbing states are an exception. For example, heart disease at age $a$ does not enter in the estimation of transitions for heart disease at age $a+1$ because it is an absorbing state: once a person has heart disease, she carries it through the rest of her life. The same is true for chronic or permanent conditions such as hypertension, having a stroke, etc.

At each age, once we obtain the transition probability for each health outcome, we draw a Monte-Carlo simulations for each subject. Thus, each simulation depends on each individual's health history and on their particular characteristics. For every simulated trajectory of health outcomes, we predict the lifetime medical expenditure using the models estimated from the MEPS and the MCBS. We then obtain an estimate of the expected lifetime medical expenditure by taking the mean of each individual's simulated lifetime medical expenditure. The same procedure is applied to QALYs.

A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) reweighs a year of life according to its quality given the burden of disease. A QALY of 1 denotes a year of life in the absence of disease (perfect health). The value of QALY for an individual in a given year is smaller than 1 when there is positive burden of disease, as worse health conditions imply lower QALYs.\footnote{When an individual dies, her QALY equals zero. It is worth noting that there are extreme combinations of disease and disability that may generate negative QALYs, although this case is unusual.} We compute a QALY model based on the EQ-5D instrument, a widely-used Health-related Quality-of-life (HRQoL) measure, available in MEPS. We then estimate this model from the PSID. Appendix~\ref{appendix:health} provides more details on this estimation strategy.

We estimate three models of medical spending: (i) Medicare spending (annual medical spending paid by parts A, B, and D of Medicare); (ii) out-of-pocket spending (medical spending paid directly by the individual); and (ii) all public spending other than Medicare. Each medical spending model is estimated through pooled weighted least squares regressions that include a person's demographics, economic status, current health, risk factors, and functional status as explanatory variables. The MCBS-based medical spending models also include lagged health because of the length of time for which MCBS subjects are observed.

\textbf{Medical Expenditure before Age 30}

We combine the MEPS and retrospective information in the ABC and CARE interviews at ages 21 and 30 related to hospitalizations at ages 12 and 15 and births at age 15. In addition to this retrospective information, we use use individual and family demographics to predict medical expenditure models for each age, as summarized in Table~\ref{table:pre30}.

\section{Results} \label{section:results}

\subsection{Treatment Effects} \label{section:teresults}

We consider \noutcomes\ measures of human development across the life cycle and count the measures for which the program had a ``socially positive'' effect, without accounting for control substitution.\footnote{These outcomes directly relate to the categories we monetize in the cost-benefit analysis. We analyze a more thorough list of outcomes in Appendix~\ref{appendix:moreoutcomes}. The results weaken, but not to a great extent. This is a consequence of adding outcomes for which it is not clear that treatment should have a positive treatment effect.} We do this for both ABC and CARE by focusing on the first phase of treatment to compare subjects who received center-based childcare to control-group subjects---noting that assignment was random.\footnote{In ABC, this implies comparing the subjects who were randomly assigned to the treatment group to the subjects who were randomly assigned to the control group, in the first phase. In CARE, this implies comparing the subjects who were randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and family education to the subjects who were randomly assigned to the control group, in the first phase as well.} Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} displays the results from this exercise: ABC and CARE positively impact a large percentage of the outcomes we consider.\footnote{The calculation of the standard errors follows from the bootstrap procedure we discuss in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.}

We can further decompose the counts in Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive} into arbitrary categories. To economize space, we present this exercise pooling ABC and CARE. That is, we decompose the effects described in the last two bars of Figure~\ref{fig:ppositive}. Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivecategory1} and Figure~\ref{fig:ppositivecategory2} present this exercise. This helps us better understand the type of outcomes the programs affected. The results indicate that a large and precise fraction of effects are positive for outcomes spanning the life cycle, from parental income to crime and including a wide variety of health categories.

Next we present an overview of outcome-specific results in Table~\ref{resultsmales} and \ref{resultsfemales}. Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} displays an extensive summary of the estimates for the \noutcomes\ outcomes we consider. Note that: (i) we arbitrarily pick the outcomes we discuss next because we consider them of economic interest; and (ii) Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} displays results accounting for multiple hypothesis testing as in \citet{Lehman_Romano_2005_AnnStat} and \citet{Romano_Shaikh_2006_AnnStat}. We do not lose significance in the majority of outcomes.

To link the results thus far to the cost-benefit analysis of the programs, we monetize the treatment effects. At each age, we calculate each of the parameters assessing the counterfactuals of interest and monetize them, as we explain in Section~\ref{section:methodology}. We provide their life-cycle accumulated net present values. Thus, for each component we obtain the net present value of its contribution to the social benefit of the programs. To calculate the net present value, we first compare the treatment to the control group. The net present value represents the benefit (or cost) to the treatment group net of the benefit (or cost) to the control group. We then calculate the net present values accounting for control substitution.

Figure~\ref{figure:npvs} presents the net present values for the main components of the cost-benefit analysis pooling males and females. The ``Baseline'' bars represent the estimates based on the first parameter of interest, comparing the treatment- to the control-group children. The ``Stay at Home'' bars represent the comparison between the treatment group and the control group children who stay at home. The ``Alternative Preschool'' bars represent the comparison between the treatment group and the control-group children who attend alternative preschools.

\subsection{Cost-benefit Analysis} \label{section:cbaresults}

We start by describing the components and the net present values for the baseline, treatment-control comparison.

The first category represents the cost of the programs' implementation. The second category quantifies the net benefits of the program.

Labor income has two components. First, the parents of the treatment-group children increased their labor supply and therefore their income. This came as a consequence of being able to drop their children off at the treatment center for between four and eight hours a day for five years. The net present value we present span the first 15 years of the treatment and control children. Second, the program produces a positive net present value on labor income of the treated children. This considers the income from age 21 all the way to retirement.

Crime is an important component. This is consistent with previous analysis of early childhood education programs \citep{Heckman_Moon_etal_2010_RateofReturn}.  We then present two main categories for health. As we more extensively report in the Appendix and as documented in \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}, ABC and CARE had substantial effects on several measures of long-term health, especially for males---e.g. body-mass index, systolic and diastolic pressure, Framigham risk index. This translates into a higher probability of survival at later ages---we document this further in Appendix~\ref{appendix:health}. Thus individuals in the treatment group incur higher medical costs. However, their health conditions enable them to lead higher quality lives, which is reflected in the net gain the program generates in the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Finally, we present the net present value of education costs. It is negative because children in the control group acquired more education throughout their life cycles. We analyze the internal rate of return and cost-benefit ratio implied by these net present values next.

Before doing so, is important to note that although the net present values from the three comparisons imply that ABC and CARE are socially beneficial, independently to control substitution, the magnitudes for some of the components do vary substantially. As we argue next, this has to do with the differences between females and males in the treatment effects that the program has. As Figure~\ref{figure:npvsf} and Figure~\ref{figure:npvsm} show, males benefit much more when the counterfactual scenario is to attend alternative preschools, while females benefit much more from the program when the counterfactual scenario is to stay at home.

Table~\ref{table:cba} summarizes the cost-benefit analysis of the programs without accounting for control substitution. All the money figures are in 2014 USD and are discounted to each child's birth age, unless otherwise specified.

Pooling males and females, the results indicate that the program is socially efficient: the baseline estimates for the internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio are \irrp\ and \bcp. The program generates a benefit of \bcp\ for every dollar spent on it. This is of particular importance because ABC and CARE were much more expensive than other early childhood education programs like Perry or Head Start \citep{Elango_Hojman_etal_2016_Early-Edu}---the treatment involved more services over a longer time period.

The internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio are robust to sensitivity exercises. First, we remove the component due to parental income. In practice, ABC and CARE had a childcare subsidy component because it allowed the mothers to work causing additional parental income. This component amounts to \parincomenpvp. Even after removing this component, the internal rate of return and benefit-to-cost ratio indicate social efficiency of the program and remain statistically significant.

Parental income and crime are the components for which the internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio are the most sensitive.\footnote{We do not account for treatment effects on parental income beyond age 15 because some children report to move out of their households as early as this age. This makes ambiguous the effects that parental income could have on the subjects after age 15.} The reason for the sensitivity to parental income is that the amount is substantial and it is not heavily discounted because it accumulates during the first $15$ years of the children's life. Although crime is subject to more discounting, the amount due to crime savings is large so removing it diminishes both the internal rate of return and the benefit-to-cost ratio.

The estimates are robust to individually removing the rest of the components, and in most cases remain statistically significant. This happens for one of either two reasons: (i) the effects are substantial but they are heavily discounted because they happen later in life---e.g. labor income; or (ii) the effects happen early in life but are not as substantial---as in the amount that the control-group parents pay for their children to attend alternative preschools.

Next, we analyze the estimates when splitting the sample by males and females. Some of the estimates lose significance due to the reduction of observations after splitting the sample by gender. The point estimates remain robust across  the sensitivity analysis.

For females, we observe consistency except for the case where we remove the parental income component. We can observe that the female sample is the main driver of parental income when comparing its net present value between females and males.

For males, the estimates are robust, similar to the female samples. An exception occurs when we remove the component corresponding to quality-adjusted life years. Although the cost-to-benefit ratio remains virtually unchanged, the internal rate of return is negative. In this case, the internal rate of return is actually uninformative: it is negative due to the fact that, when excluding the quality-adjusted life years, the net-benefit streams cross from negative to positive generating multiple roots. The interpretation of the internal rate of return when the net-benefit streams cross in unclear \citep{Arrow-Levhari_1969_EJ}.\footnote{This reinforces the importance of considering the quality-life improvement due to better health conditions.}

The first row represents the baseline estimates. The rest of the rows present estimates for scenarios in which we remove the NPV estimates of the component listed in the first column. The quantity listed in the NPV columns is the component we actually remove when computing the calculation in each row. All the money figures are in 2014 USD and are discounted to each child's birth, unless otherwise specified. For the B/C we use a discount rate of $3\%$, unless otherwise specified. We test the null hypotheses $\text{IRR} = 3\%$ and $\text{B/C} = 1$---we elect $3\%$ because that is the discount rate we use. The results in bold are significant at the 10\% level in a single-sided, non-parametric, bootstrapped test. We resample both the experimental and the auxiliary data sources.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{sidewaystable}

Finally, we provide a cost-benefit analysis of the program when accounting for control substitution (Table~\ref{table:cbacs}). The first row shows the estimates without accounting for control substitution, i.e. the same as those of the first row in Table~\ref{table:cba}. The second and third rows present results for the two counterfactual comparisons we consider.

Before discussing the results, it is worth noting that the sample sizes for some of the cases make the IRR estimates very unstable. For example, the estimates for females compared to the counterfactual of staying at home are based on an initial sample of 5 observations in the control group, while the estimates for males are based on 7  observations in the control group.\footnote{That is, we observe 5 females and 7 males in the control group who did not attend alternative preschools. Some of the forecasts could be based on even smaller samples due to missing values in some specific outcomes.} In the specific case of females, the internal rate of return corresponding to the counterfactual of staying at home is based on crossing net-benefit streams. Similarly, we cannot obtain a real solution for the case of males.

The samples used to produce estimates relative to enrollment in alternatives preschools are larger than those previously mentioned and we are able to obtain real solutions for the IRR even after splitting by males and females. Despite these practical difficulties, the results are consistent with the treatment effects we show in Section~\ref{section:teresults}. Compared to ABC and CARE, females benefit more than males from alternative preschools relative to staying at home. That is, the benefit-to-cost ratio of ABC and CARE relative to staying at home is high for females and low for males. Conversely, the benefit-to-cost ratio of ABC and CARE relative to alternative preschools is high for males and low for females. Given the outcomes that we are able to monetize have higher values for males than for females, the pooled results are more similar to the results for males than to the results for females. Regardless, any of the counterfactual comparisons we consider indicates that ABC and CARE are socially efficient.

\section{Summary} \label{section:conclusion}

The evidence from policies related to early childhood education is still scarce despite its importance in the public debate. We provide a thorough evaluation of two randomized controlled trials: the Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE).

As programs providing high-quality center-based childcare, ABC and CARE have positive effects on a variety of outcomes measuring human development throughout childhood to adulthood---including cognition, socio-emotional skills, criminal activity, and adulthood health. This translates into statistically and economically significant measures of social efficiency, like the benefit-to-cost ratio and the internal rate of return, which we calculate accounting for complications that arise when evaluating social programs and considering life-cycle gains.

When adequately assessed, early childhood education programs enhance human development in that they provide a vehicle to promote social mobility. An adequate assessment requires: (i) comparing the program with respect to a well-defined counterfactual---e.g. other programs or staying at home; and (ii) monetizing the life-cycle gains, which goes beyond back-of-the-envelope calculations based on short-term gains.
