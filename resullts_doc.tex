\textbf{[JJH: These categories are never defined.][We now define them in Appendix C.]}


\textbf{[JJH: No difference [between IQ, achievement, parenting, social-emotional for controls]?][None of those are statistically different than 1/2.]}

\textbf{[JJH: Report p-values for each column.][We report the p-values testing if the control proportion is equal to the treatment proportion.]}

\textbf{[JJH: Report after treatment on control plot.][This is implemented. We replaced the previous figures (control and treatment separate) with Figure~\ref{fig:proportion}.]}

\textbf{[We no longer report the proportion value-added as the plots you suggested are much clearer.]}

\textbf{[We added a moderator of mother's locus of control (Figure~\ref{mlocus}). It shows that boys are hurt (relative to girls) when mothers have external loci of control. This is the case for all outcomes except health.}]

\footnotesize \justify
Note: These plots show the proportion of outcomes, by outcome category, for which the males' mean is larger than the females' mean. The standard errors and the $p$-values are computed using 100 bootstraps. The $p$-values are one-sided and test the null hypothesis that the proportion of outcomes is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. All the variables are coded such that higher values correspond to socially desirable outcomes. The variables for each outcome category are listed in Appendix C.
