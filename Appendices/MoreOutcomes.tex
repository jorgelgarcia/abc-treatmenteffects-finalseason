\section{{Expanding the Analyzed Outcomes}} \label{appendix:moreoutcomes}

\noindent In this appendix, we expand the analysis in Section~\ref{section:c-functions} by considering an additional set of outcomes. Instead of considering \noutcomes, we consider \noutcomesexpp\ when pooling the sample and \noutcomesexpm\ and \noutcomesexpf\ when for males and females, respectively. Table \ref{tab:suppl-outcomes} lists supplemental outcomes that we do not consider in our primary analysis.\footnote{We fail to estimate some treatment effects because in some cases the treatment indicator and the controls entirely determine the outcome. For the \noutcomes\ in Section~\ref{section:c-functions}, we do not have this problem.} The difference between this set of outcomes and the set we present in Section~\ref{section:c-functions} is that (i) the outcomes in Section~\ref{section:c-functions} contain outcomes we monetize when computing the cost-benefit analysis; and (ii) it is not entirely clear if treatment should have an effect on the outcomes we add in this appendix. The \noutcomesexpp\ outcomes in this appendix include the \noutcomes\ outcomes in Section~\ref{section:c-functions}.\\

\noindent To illustrate the difference between the outcomes in this appendix and the outcomes in Section~\ref{section:c-functions}, consider two outcomes related to employment. In Section~\ref{section:c-functions}, we include employment at age 30. In this appendix, we include both employment at age 30 and job satisfaction at age 30. Job satisfaction is a subjective variable, and it is not as clear what the effect of treatment on outcome is.\\

\noindent Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts_all} presents the results for the pooled sample, and Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_male_counts_all} and \ref{table:abccare_rslt_female_counts_all} present the results for males and females.
The statistics presented in the first row of these tables count the number of socially positive treatment effects as a percentage of all treatment effects. The statistics are bolded if they are significantly different from 50\% at the 10\% level. The statistics in the second row count the	number of socially positive treatment effects that are significant at the 10\% level as a percentage of all treatment effects. Each statistic is bolded if it is significantly different than 10\% at the 10\% level. It is still the case both that (i) we find a majority of positive treatment effects; and (ii) more than 10\% of these positive treatment effects are significant at the 10\%. It is true that the results weaken if compared to those we consider in Section~\ref{section:c-functions}, but this is expected given how we construct the lists of outcomes.

 Appendix~\ref{appendix:morebycat} present the results by categories. The tables that mention \textbf{10\% significance} in their labels present statistics that count the number of socially positive treatment effects that are significant at the 10\% level as a percentage of all treatment effects. Each statistic is bolded if it is significantly different than 10\% at the 10\% level. The tables that do not mention \textbf{10\% significance} in their labels present statistics that count the number of socially positive treatment effects as a percentage of all treatment effects. Each statistic is bolded if it is significantly different than 50\% at the 10\% level.
