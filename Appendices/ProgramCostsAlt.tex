\section[Program Costs of ABC]{Program Costs of ABC\footnote{This section of the paper is based on joint work with Sylvi Kuperman.}} \label{app:programcosts}

\noindent In this appendix, we document the sources informing our programs' costs calculation in Section~\ref{section:programscosts}. We use a battery of primary sources obtained in the Archives of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill---Records of the Office of the Vice Chancellor \citet{UNC-Archives_Health-Affairs}. A copy of these battery of documents is available upon request. Figure~\ref{figure:who} exemplifies one of these sources, in which the monthly cost of treatment per child for the year 1977 is categorized by source of funding.

\noindent Figure~\ref{figure:wages} is another of our sources and it is the base of our calculation of personnel costs.

\noindent Interviews with the programs' staff \citet{projectcare2014interviews,abc2014-2015interviews}, inform us about additional costs of the programs. An example is the salary of a social worker, who is not part of some of the of the costs estimates reported before but was part of the staff implementing treatment. These interviews are available upon request.\\ 

\noindent Finally, a valuable source is a report written by the program staff \citet{FPG_1979_Progress-Report}. As we note in Section~\ref{section:programscosts}, this report produced an estimate of the cost in a completely independent way, although perhaps using a the same or similar primary sources. Our calculation of the costs comes very close to those in \citet{FPG_1979_Progress-Report}.
