\section[Background]{Background\footnote{Sylvi Kuperman greatly assisted us in preparing this section of the appendix.}} \label{appendix:background}

\subsection{Overview}

\noindent The Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) were high-quality early childhood education programs. Each had two phases of randomized controlled design. They were both implemented at the Frank Porter Graham Center (FPGC) of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. ABC served four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1977, and CARE served two cohorts of children born between 1977 and 1980. In this section of the appendix, we expand on important details of the eligibility requirements, the randomization protocol, and the programmatic contents of both programs. Table~\ref{tab:programcomparison}. offers a visual summary and comparison of the two programs.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria and Populations Served}\label{app:eligibility-pop}

\noindent The mothers of the ABC and CARE subjects were generally recruited during the last trimester  of pregnancy. Potential families were referred by local social service agencies and hospitals. Eligibility was determined by a score of 11 or more on a weighted 13-factor High-risk Index (HRI). Table~\ref{table:hri-abc} details the items of the HRI for ABC.

Note: This table shows the High-risk Index (HRI) for ABC. A score of 11 or more determined eligibility \citep{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_Campbell_1984_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Ramey_Campbell_etal_2000_ADS}. The weighting scale aimed to establish the relative importance of each item in the index \citep{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD}. Race was not  considered for eligibility; however, 98\% of the families who agreed to participate were African-American\citep{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.
\end{table}

\noindent The HRI for CARE was similar to that of ABC---it also contained 13 weighted variables and a score of 11 or above was required to be considered eligible. The items for maternal and paternal education levels have the same categories and weights as the ABC HRI. The other identical items are having an absent father,  school-age siblings performing lower than the norm based on grade-level or achievement tests, a record of father's unstable job history or unskilled labor, social agencies indicating a high level of need, and other circumstances related to cultural or social disadvantage. The specification of the following items were changed between the ABC and CARE HRI. The weight associated with household income depended on the number of individuals in the family for CARE and the income categories range from less than \$11,327.08 to \$76,457.80 (2014 USD) or more. In the CARE HRI, it is determined if payments were received from welfare agencies in the past 5 years instead of the past 3 years. Similarly, it determines if any family member has sought counseling in the past 5 years instead of the past 3 years. The threshold for maternal or paternal IQ is 85 in the CARE HRI instead of 90 as in the ABC HRI.  It does not have an item related to the absence of maternal relatives in the area, but replaces that item with asking if any member of the mother or father's immediate family has received services for the mentally disabled (the weight for this item is 3).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} 

\noindent All subjects were substantially disadvantaged (see Figure~\ref{figure:hridistabc} and Figure~\ref{figure:hridistcare}). Maternal age when the subject was born was, on average, 19.9 years in ABC and 21.1 years in CARE. Approximately half of the mothers of both treatment-group and control-group subjects in ABC were 19 years or younger and one third were 17 years or younger. In CARE, approximately half of the mothers of both treatment-group and control-group subjects were 20 years or younger and one third were 17.2 years or younger.  Mean maternal IQ score in ABC was approximately 85, one standard deviation below the national mean. In CARE, the mean maternal IQ score was approximately 87. Only 25\% of the ABC subjects lived with both biological parents, and more than 50\% lived with extended families in multi-generational households (61\% of treatment-group subjects and 56\% of control-group subjects).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.} About 79\% of subjects did not have a father in the home in both ABC and CARE.

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises} \label{appendix:randomization}

\noindent Randomization compromises throughout ABC's and CARE's implementations pose a challenge for evaluating the programs' effects. We discuss each case of compromise in detail. Figure~\ref{fig:abc-flow} and Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} are flow charts that depict the sample from the first-phase randomization through the last data follow-up accounting for all cases of attrition and non-compliance.

\noindent Although most randomization compromises occurred at early stages, our methodology also accounts for the fact that a few subjects were not in the sample either for the second-phase randomization or for the adult follow-ups. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}, we describe the sample reductions that attrition at different stages of the study generates and test potential differences between the subjects who completed data follow-ups and the subjects who did not.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{ABC}

\noindent Both the first and second phases of randomization were conducted at the family level, so pairs of siblings and twins were jointly randomized into either treatment or control groups.\footnote{Sibling pairs occurred when the two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that pairing was based on HRI, maternal IQ, maternal education, maternal age, and gender of the subject, we do not know the original pairs. The study collected an initial sample of 120 families, with a total of 123 potentially eligible children. After removing 2 subjects who were mentally disabled, 4 subjects who left the study for unspecified reasons, and 3 subjects who died before 6 months of age, there are 114 subjects from 112 families who are part of the initial sample. Including these 9 subjects, twenty two subjects did not complete the first-phase of treatment as initially assigned by the randomization. We classify these subjects into eight categories in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} and describe them next.\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}, we compare the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} to the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.}

\noindent \textbf{[JJH: Do you realize what chaos this imprecise writing will visit on us? Can you write a coherent form of a timeline?] [JLG: There is a confusion between randomization compromises and chronology of attrition. This section (A3) contains randomization compromises. I included a new section which is a chronology of attrition (A4). \\ \\
Please note that in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} there is a difference between the individual departing from the initial assignment and data being available. Example: Some individuals departed from the program at age 3 becomes their families moved. Later, however, data on them was collected and we consider them as treated in our calculations.]}

\noindent First, there were four subjects assigned to treatment who left the study before any data on them was collected. In our main methodology, we assume that they are missing at random. 

\noindent Second, four subjects died before age 5---two of them initially assigned to treatment and two of them initially assigned to control. For all of them, we observe baseline characteristics and any other data collected before their death. For methodological purposes, they represent cases of program attrition when we do not observe their outcomes.

\noindent Third, three subjects in the treatment group did not comply to treatment status. They are different from the four subjects who left the study before any data collection because we observe data collected for them from birth to age 8. Afterward, the program staff chose not to follow them anymore.\footnote{Informal conversations with the program's staff do not indicate a clear reason for this.} Therefore, these subjects remain in treatment sample until age 8 or before. After, they represent cases of program attrition, given that we do not observe them anymore.

\input{output/abc_compromises}

\noindent Fourth, one subject initially assigned to control was enrolled into treatment. The mother wanted to work and the program staff decided to admit her child into center-based care.\footnote{Correspondence with the program officers stating this permission is available under request from the authors.} Both in terms of data collection and in terms of methodological purposes, this subject is analogous to the subjects in the third case.\footnote{The sensitivity analysis finding little evidence when adjusting for non-compliance includes this case.}

\noindent Fifth, four subjects in the treatment group did not complete treatment in its entirety. They were treated for at most 10 months. Except for follow-ups during childhood, which our main results do not use, we observe most of the data for these subjects. We avoid taking a stand on how beneficial the program was at each age, because we do not have a way to document this. Therefore, we assume that they were treated as other subjects in the treatment group.\footnote{If anything, this downward biases the effects of the program we estimate.} 

\noindent Sixth, the family of one subject in the control group moved at age 54 months. We observe data before the family moved, so we consider the subject as part of the control group in any estimation before this event. Afterwards, we do not observe any data on the subject, so we consider her a case of program attrition.

\noindent Seventh, two subjects initially assigned to treatment status were diagnosed as developmentally delayed after 6 and 36 months of treatment. No data for them are available after the diagnosis. We drop them from the sample because they were not eligible to be part of the program.

\noindent Eighth, two subjects initially assigned to the control group were admitted into treatment. Local authorities requested this because the children were considered highly at risk. Data on them are available from birth to age 8. Although they crossed over from the control group to the treatment group, we consider them to be members of the control group who attrited after age 8.

\noindent Analysis of each of these cases leads to the following conclusions. For four subjects, we do not have data to assess them as cases of program attrition, though sensitivity analyses suggest that the treatment effects of the program persist after assigning them the same outcome as the subjects who did the worst in the treatment group. For the subjects who did not comply with treatment, adjusting our estimates for non-compliance when data are available makes little difference. The remaining 14 subjects who did not complete treatment as initially assigned represent various cases of program attrition, for which we propose a correction methodology in Appendix~\ref{app:method_partialobs}.

\noindent To increase the number of subjects in the sample, the program officers recruited additional subjects who were added to the program before the subjects were 6 months old. Our calculations indicate that there were eight initial replacements. We cannot distinguish in the data the subjects who were initially randomized from the replacement children and there is no documentation on how these subjects were recruited.\footnote{Three replacements are reported in \citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}. Three are documented in correspondence with the program officers, which is available from the authors upon request. The other two replacements are implied by the number of subjects who participated in the randomization protocol in each cohort.} After the various compromises, the sample consisted of 114 subjects: 58 in the treatment group and 56 in the control group. The observed characteristics for each subjects indicate that they were eligible for the program; all subjects in the sample have an HRI of 11 or above. 

\noindent Prior to the second phase of randomization, 3 subjects in the first-phase control group and 3 subjects in the first-phase treatment group could not be located for follow-up. One subject in the control group and eight subjects in the treatment group of the first phase did not participate in the second phase but later agreed to participate in the data collections during adulthood. This yields a sample of 96 subjects in the second phase: 49 in treatment and 47 in control. After the second-phase randomization, three subjects in the treatment group chose not to participate in the program, while all subjects in the control group adhered to their randomization status. 

\noindent \textbf{[JJH: We need a chronology of attrition.] [JLG: Coming after randomization compromises of CARE.]} 

\subsubsection{CARE}

\noindent The randomization protocol in CARE had no major compromises.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD,Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} Of the 65 initial families, 23 were randomized to a control group, 25 to the family education treatment group (we do not consider this group in our combined ABC/CARE sample), and 17 to the family education and center-based childcare treatment group. Two families in the family education treatment group had twins who were jointly randomized, as in ABC. We document four cases of program attrition (see Table~\ref{table:care_compromises}).\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}, we compare the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:care_compromises} to the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.} For methodological purposes, we consider these subjects analogous to their corresponding cases in ABC. We do not present exercises to evaluate the sensitivity to non-compliance because there was none in CARE. Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} illustrates CARE's randomization protocol and the presence of subjects throughout the data follow-ups.
\input{output/care_compromises}

\subsection{Chronology of Attrition}


Over time, various subjects in both ABC and CARE left the studies for different reasons. We describe the chronology of this attrition. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}, we describe how we adjust for this attrition in the methodology.

\subsubsection{ABC}

Before randomization, there was an initial pool of 123 subjects from 120 families. Four subjects left the study even before baseline data could be collected. In addition, 3 subjects died before 6 months of age and 2 subjects were diagnosed as mentally disabled making them ineligible for the study. The sample at the beginning of the study is thus 114 subjects (56 in the control group, 58 in the treatment group). 

Before age 5, an additional subject died. Public officials requested that 2 control-group subjects be moved to the treatment group due to extremely impoverished home conditions. Three treatment-group subjects and 1 control-group subject did not comply with the randomization. The researchers at FPG continued collecting data on these 3 cases of non-compliance until age 8 when the researchers decided to halt data collection on these non-compliant cases. These cases were also described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:randomization} due to the fact that they are randomization compromises.

After age 5, 1 subject moved away from the study area and 7 subjects attrited from the study. At age 21, 99 subjects participated in the data collection (51 in the control group, 48 in the treatment group).

Between age 21 and 30, 2 subjects died and 4 of the 7 attrited subjects were recovered leading to an age-30 sample of 101 subjects (52 in the control group, 49 in the treatment group).

Many subjects were not included in the age-34 data collection because they had to travel to go to a clinic rather than having at-home visitors, which is how the previous data collections were done. Because of this inconvenience to the subjects, data are only available on 72 subjects (34 in the control group, 38 in the treatment group).


\subsubsection{CARE}

We describe the chronology of attrition for the two experimental groups that we use in the data (the control group and the group that received center-based childcare and family education). Before randomization, there were 40 subjects. Four moved away from the study area. Between the start of the program and age 5, there was no attrition. These cases are also described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:randomization} due to the fact that they are randomization compromises.

Four subjects attrited after age 5 and were not recovered at later data collections. In the age-34 medical sweep, data were collected on 22 subjects (11 in the control group, 11 in the treatment group).

\subsection{Program Description and Content}

\subsubsection{Goals}
\noindent The original goals of treatment were to prevent mental retardation by enhancing overall development from birth, in turn fostering school-readiness for an at-risk population.\footnote{Note that the clinical understanding of mental retardation was once associated with disadvantages that hindered early-life development \citep{Mental-Retardation_America_2004_BOOK_NYU}.} Additional curriculum goals were to (i) support language, motor, and cognitive development; (ii) minimize high-risk behaviors; and (iii) develop socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task-orientation, communicative competence, independence, and prosocial behavior.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.} Implementation of ABC's and CARE's educational treatments evolved each successive year as program staff evaluated ongoing outcome data.\footnote{ \citet{Ramey-etal_1975_AJoMD, Finkelstein_1982_Day_Care_YC, McGinness_1982_Language-Poverty-Child,Haskins_1985_CD}.}


\subsubsection{Daily Schedule}
\noindent For both ABC and CARE, FPGC was open to families from 7:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., 5 days per week and 50 weeks per year.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} Subjects were offered free transportation to and from the center. A driver and second adult staffed each vehicle (one van and two station wagons) equipped with child safety seats.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Approximately 65\% of treated ABC families utilized the free transportation.\footnote{\citet{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost}.} Vehicles typically arrived by 9:00 a.m. to the center and departed around 3:45 p.m.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} At FPGC, ABC and CARE treatment-group subjects received breakfast, lunch, and a snack planned by a nutritionist.\footnote{ \citet{Haskins_1985_CD, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} Meals were catered by off-site kitchens. Infants received iron-fortified formula  until doctors advised adding solid food. The control-group subjects also received an unlimited amount of iron-fortified formula until approximately 15 months of age.\footnote{\citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,abc2014-2015interviews}.}

\subsubsection{Program Staff and Physical Space}
\noindent To promote trust in FPGC within the subjects' families, staff were recruited from the local community.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Feagans_1996_Childrens-Talk,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Infant and toddler caregivers and preschool teachers demonstrated varied educational backgrounds ranging from high school graduation to master's degrees. Their average professional working experience with young children was 7 years.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} All classroom staff participated in extensive training and were closely observed by FPGC's academic staff, as part of a broad variety of ongoing clinical and social research related to early childhood education, psychology, and health. In ABC, child-caregiver ratios varied by age: 3:1 for infants up to 13 to 15 months of age; 4:1 for toddlers up to 36 months; and 5:1 or 6:1 for children aged 3 to 5 years, depending on cohort size.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach}.} Child-caregiver ratios were similar in CARE.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}

\noindent The ABC and CARE staff included a program director, a secretary, 12 to 14 teachers and assistant teachers, 3 administrative staff members, and a transportation supervisor.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} Lead caregivers and teachers had bachelor's or master's degrees. Teacher aides, recruited from the local community, held high school diplomas (at minimum) and were comparatively well-compensated in the childcare field. They remained a stable treatment component throughout the study. After 1980, following revisions to FIDCR regarding minimum requirements for early childhood education staff, several teacher aides pursued and received undergraduate degrees and became lead teachers. All classroom staff were supervised daily, received weekly mentoring, and professional development from outside consultants..\footnote{\citet{Obrien-Sanders_1974_ABC-brochure, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sanders-Stokes_1979_Status-Report,Klein-Sanders_1982_Status-Report,abc2014-2015interviews}.}

\noindent Infant nurseries, toddler rooms, and preschool classrooms were housed on different floors of FPGC. Early reports indicate that FPGC allocated two floors to ABC, but later reports indicate the use of three floors.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_1981_Modification}.} Two infant nurseries were staffed by five adults in a suite of four adjoining rooms: two sleeping rooms contained seven cribs each, while the other two rooms were designated for activities.\footnote{ \citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} The four rooms opened into a large, shared space with feeding tables, an area for food preparation, and a couch.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.} Offices for the medical staff, along with two examining rooms and facilities for laboratory tests were located around the corner from the infant nurseries.\footnote{\citet{abc2014-2015interviews}.} Two multi-age toddler rooms were located one floor below the infant nurseries. One room served children who were 1 to 2 years old and the other served children 2 to 3 years old.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.} 3-year-olds were housed in a closed classroom near the toddler rooms. On the lowest floor, 4-year-olds shared an open classroom with a public kindergarten program; the two classes were separated by a long, low bookcase. In CARE, two floors of FPGC were allocated to nurseries and classrooms. A mixed-age classroom design was implemented combining children ages 1 and 3, and children ages 2 and 4. Teacher-child ratios for these ages remained 1:5. FPGC offered two outdoor play areas for both ABC and CARE: one for children up to age 3, and the other for older children.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach}.}

\subsubsection{Approach to Child Development}
%Direct from the paper
\noindent Curriculum delivery enabled a highly customized learning experience for treated subjects in both ABC and CARE. Infant caregivers recorded child observations on progress charts and collaborated with FPGC's curriculum developers and academic researchers to rotate learning activities every 2 to 3 weeks for each treated subject.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.} Preschool rooms featured intentionally organized environments to promote pre-literacy and access to a rich set of learning tools. The full-day curriculum emphasized active learning experiences, dramatic play, and pre-academics. Frequent 1:1 or 2:1 child-adult interactions prioritized language development for social competence. For ages 3 through 5, as the cohorts approached public school entry, classroom experiences were increasingly structured  towards the development of pre-academic skills and ``socio-linguistic and communicative competence.''\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Haskins_1985_CD, Ramey_1981_Modification, Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree,Sparling_Lewis_1984_BOOKLearningGamesThreesFours}.} FPGC offered a summer program before the start of kindergarten designed to target specific skills to ensure success in a kindergarten classroom (e.g., lining up when exiting the classroom). This program was available to subjects in both the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} 

\noindent ABC's and CARE's learning programs were influenced by the writings of major developmental theorists.\footnote{These include including Bowlby, Piaget, and Vygotsky. \citep{Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH,Mcginness_1981_Developing,abc2014-2015interviews}.} All four ABC cohorts and two CARE cohorts participated in curriculum developers Sparling and Lewis' ``LearningGames for the First Three Years.''\footnote{ \citet{Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree}.} The ``LearningGames'' were implemented daily by infant and toddler caregivers in 1:1 child-adult interactions. Each ``LearningGames'' activity stated a developmentally-appropriate objective, the necessary materials, directions for teacher behavior, and expected child outcome. The activities were designed for use both indoors and outdoors, while dressing, eating, bathing, or during play.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_1981_Modification,Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree}.}

\noindent Supplemental curricula for preschool rooms varied throughout the study, and included ``Cook and Learn,'' ``Peabody Early Experiences Kit,'' ``GOAL Math Program,'' and ``My Friends and Me.''\footnote{ \citet{Greenberg_Epstein_1973_BOOKBridgestoreading,Karnes1973,Dunn_Chun_etal_1976_BOOKPeabodyearlyeducation,Davis_1977_BOOKMyfriends,Wallach_1976_Teaching-All-Children}.}
%SK notes to co-authors: I'm currently waiting for info from Lynne Vernon-Feagans to potentially include a social worker to the list of staff!

\noindent CARE subjects randomized into the center-based childcare and family education group or the family education group also received home visits designed to transmit information on child development and skills involved with parenting including strategies for parent-child interactions based on ``LearningGames" activities and problem-solving techniques.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} Home visitors were trained to ensure they were able to form a strong relationship with the parent and successfully implement the curriculum.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The visits lasted about an hour, and occurred weekly until the child was 3 years old. After age 3, the home visits were less frequent and depended on the preferences of the parents. They were usually about once a month after age 3.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} 

\subsubsection{Medical Care and Nutrition}
%Direct from the paper
ABC and CARE provided comprehensive on-site medical care because it was conducted in conjunction with a longitudinal medical research study on infectious respiratory diseases in group environments.\footnote{\citet{Henderson-et-al_1982_NEJoM}.} Treatment group children were monitored daily for signs of illness. All treated children received medical care while attending center-based childcare; the first ABC cohort of control-group children also received medical care during the program's first year of implementation.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.}$^{,}$\footnote{Subjects in both the treatment and control groups of the first cohort received free medical care provided by ABC. The control group of the first cohort only received medical care in the first year of the program; the treatment group of the first cohort received medical care for all years of the program. In the subsequent cohorts, only subjects in the treatment group received free medical care provided by ABC. Both CARE cohorts of treated subjects received medical care.}
%Direct from the paper

\noindent In ABC, primary pediatric care was provided by a family nurse practitioner and a licensed practical nurse, both under the supervision of one pediatrician who was on continuous duty at the center.\footnote{\citet{Haskins-et-al_1978_JoPP}.} In CARE, the medical staff included two pediatricians, a family nurse practitioner, and a licensed practical nurse.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The medical staff provided regularly scheduled check-ups, immunizations, parental counseling, and initial assessment of illnesses.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The treatment group received standard check-ups when they were 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months old and annually thereafter. While in treatment, they also received the standard immunizations.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}.} In ABC, a licensed practical nurse visited classrooms for up to two hours on a daily basis to monitor the subjects' health status.\footnote{\citet{Sanyal_Henderson_etal_1980_JoPediatrics}.} Although this medical care was offered to the treatment-group families free of charge, it was the policy of the medical staff to refer families to a community hospital for serious treatment. While ABC and CARE provided aspirin, immunizations, and basic medicines, families were responsible for purchasing any prescription medication subjects required. There are no data currently available on treatment received for serious conditions or use of prescription medication.  

\noindent Infants were supplied with iron-fortified formula. Children older than 15 months of age were provided breakfast, lunch, and an
afternoon snack all planned by a nutritionist.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Control families received diapers for up to three years and unlimited iron-fortified bottled formula through 15 months.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}

\subsubsection{School-age Treatment}

\noindent The ABC subjects were randomized into a second-phase, school-age treatment (95 subjects continued to this stage of treatment). The CARE subjects in the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group received the school-age treatment without randomization. The school-age treatment lasted for the first three years of elementary school and consisted of home visits conducted by a Home/School Resource Teacher.\footnote{\cite{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} These visits were structured to increase exposure to reading and mathematics and promote parental involvement in the academic process.

\noindent The curriculum was delivered through sets of activities that developed skills such as handwriting, phonics, and math facts.\footnote{There were about 60 activities per year. See \cite{Campbell-Ramey_1989_Preschool-vs-School-age} for details.} Teachers worked to encourage parental involvement in the subjects' academics and provided incentives to families to comply with the treatment, such as giving gift certificates to restaurants and books for the subjects upon the completion of activity packets. 

\noindent Teachers had graduate-level education, training in special education, \textit{or} were qualified to act as consultants for in-school teachers to address any problems that arose.\footnote{\cite{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty}.} They met with parents at home and with teachers in the schools to deliver new activities for the parents to complete with their children and discuss the child's level of success with the previous set of activities. In addition, they helped parents with issues such as adult literacy, housing, and medical care. Thus, the teacher had a dual role as a parent educator and an advocate for the subject in their educational institution.

\subsection{Control Group Substitution}\label{app:control-subbb}

\noindent In ABC, the families of $75\%$ of the control-group subjects enrolled their children in alternative center-based childcare. In CARE, $74\%$ of families in the control group and $62\%$ of families in the family education group enrolled their children in alternative center-based childcare. We refer to this phenomenon as control substitution; accounting for it is fundamental when evaluating the program. In this Appendix, we describe the characteristics and costs of the childcare centers providing alternative treatment, in order to create a comparison with the treatments offered by ABC and CARE.

\noindent Most of the families in the ABC and CARE control groups enrolled their children in alternative preschool that received federal subsidies and, therefore, were regulated. Figure~\ref{fig:ccabc} and Figure~\ref{fig:cccare} show the amount of enrollment into subsidized and non-subsidized care for ABC and CARE, respectively. Subsidized centers were required to have trained staff who were able to implement curricula designed to enhance cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev}.} Thus, we consider these centers to offer high-quality center-based childcare.

Subsidized centers were highly regulated and, therefore, relatively high-quality. Non-subsidized childcare services were center-based but not regulated. Other sources of childcare could have included care by parents, relatives, or non-relatives.}

	\end{figure}
	
Table~\ref{table:controlsubscharacteristics} shows baseline characteristics between the control-group subjects who were enrolled in alternative preschool and those who stayed at home. The control-group children who attended alternative preschool were marginally more advantaged, with the most stark difference being maternal employment. This is seen across genders, but is only significant for the female and pooled samples. The males who are enrolled in alternative preschool have mothers with higher IQ scores, but lower parental income indicating lack of spousal support, which is evident by the fewer number of fathers present in that same group. Those who were enrolled in alternative preschools also had more siblings.

Figure~\ref{fig:salmonella} shows enrollment by age and the average months of enrollment by age for the control-group children who enrolled in program alternatives. Enrollment increases with the age of children. Figure~\ref{fig:treatsubcare_2} shows the fraction of children enrolled in preschool by age. As control children age, they are more likely to enter childcare.

\subsubsection{Quality of Alternative Preschools}  \label{appendix:tetanus}

\noindent During the period when both ABC and CARE were active, North Carolina had an active, high-quality system of public childcare for vulnerable families funded by several public programs. Examples include Title IV-A of the Social Service Administration (SSA), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and Title IV-B of Child Welfare Services. These funding efforts were amplified in 1975 by Title XX of the SSA, Social Services Block Grant, which was the main federal source of childcare financing in the U.S. when ABC and CARE were active.\footnote{\citet{Robins_1988_Federal-Child-Care}.}

\noindent Federally funded childcare services were regulated according to FIDCR standards, which defined stringent regulation for center-based programs for children between the ages of 3 and 6.\footnote{\citet{Department-of-Health_1968_DayCareRequirements}.} These requirements were enforced.\footnote{\citet{Kuperman_2015_Clifford-Russell-Interview}.} Additionally, North Carolina had a mandatory licensing law for childcare facilities. While FIDCR applied to centers for older children (between the ages of 3 and 6), the North Carolina regulation only applied to centers serving children below the age of 3. The relative weakness of this regulation is not very relevant for our study because treatment substitution occurred mostly after age 3 (see Figure~\ref{fig:ccabc} and Figure~\ref{fig:cccare}).\footnote{\citet{NCGA_1971_House-Bill-100}.} Table~\ref{table:staff} compares a widely-used quality standard, the child-staff ratio, between the North Carolina and FIDCR standards and the actual ABC and CARE numbers.

\subsubsection{Costs}
% Need citations
\noindent Previous papers have used childcare cost rates that are not specific to North Carolina and do not account for the contemporaneous structure of the subsidies \citep{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost,Barnett_Masse_2007_EER}. We use the local subsidy rates that were in place when the ABC subjects were in preschool to impute different costs of the alternative preschools. These costs depend on the specific preschool attended and the eligibility of the families to receive the subsidies. 

\noindent When ABC and CARE were in operation, center-based childcare was subsidized by several federal programs (the Department of Social Services categorized these programs as Child Welfare, AFDC, and Work Incentive Programs).\footnote{\citet{NC-State-Dept_1972_Licensed-Day-Care}.} However, our calculations of the cost of alternative preschool are simplified by the fact that the subsidies were centralized and regulated by the County Department of Social Services. Those departments used a uniform subsidy rate, regardless of the origin of the funds.\footnote{\citet{Ad-Hoc-NC_1974_Letter}.} We collected information about the subsidy rate at the time, which approximates the price of the centers, as centers pegged their fees and services to the maximum subsidy rate. Moreover, we know which centers each ABC control subject attended. We interviewed North Carolina childcare staff and academics that study childcare to document which of those centers were subsidized and regulated at the time.\footnote{\citet{Kuperman_2015_Clifford-Russell-Interview,Kuperman-Hojman_2015_Hodgers-Interview}.} For subsidized centers, we impute the maximum Department of Social Services fee established at the time: \$633/month in 2014 USD.\footnote{\citet{Ad-Hoc-NC_1974_Letter,Comm-Plan-Serv_1973_Durhams-Share}.} For non-subsidized centers, we impute the mean of costs for Level-1 centers (minimum accepted quality level) according to a 1982 North Carolina study of the cost of childcare: \$298/month in 2014 USD.\footnote{\citet{NC-Admin-Branch_1982_Day-Care-Cost-Study}.} Although the information in this survey is not ideal for assessing the cost of subsidized preschools for CARE, as the subsidies greatly changed after the end of FIDCR (1981), it provides an approximation for assessing the cost of the non-subsidized centers. 

\noindent Finally, we determine if the families paid the costs themselves or if they were subsidized, in which case we also add deadweight costs. We consider if a subject was eligible for subsidies if the family lived in poverty according to the federal guidelines and all parents living at home worked. If a family is deemed eligible, then we assume the child's preschool was fully subsidized using the rates described above without additional subsidies.

\subsection{Data} \label{appendix:data}

In Table~\ref{tab:ecvars_1} through Table~\ref{tab:adultvars_2}, we summarize the data availability for both ABC and CARE. The data collection processes in both programs were designed to be similar. For both programs, the treatment and control groups were followed into adulthood with relatively low attrition. For ABC, subjects were followed annually through elementary school and at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30. Health and administrative crime data were collected when the subjects reached their mid-30s. For CARE, the exact same follow-ups are available with the exception of the age 15 follow-up.

Note: This plot shows the number of participants in ABC for whom there exists data at the periods of data collection by experimental group. The children who withdrew from the study did so due to several reasons, such as adoption. Children were not followed if they were found to be biologically retarded after randomization. The numbers in the bars indicate the number of individuals who were interviewed during that phase of data collection. The original sample was measured after randomization but before the start of the program, the baseline sample was measured at the start of the program, and the health sample was collected at age 34.

\end{comment}

\noindent Attrition was low in ABC. Information is available on 100 subjects in the age 30 follow-up, which we call the adult follow-up. In addition, 80 subjects---40 from the control group and 40 from the treatment group---consented to the release of their criminal records. Further, 70 participants consented to the release of information regarding a full-range biomedical panel---31 from the control group and 39 from the treatment group. 

\noindent Attrition was also low for CARE subjects. Information is available on 58 subjects (more than 85\% of the initial sample) in the age-30 follow-up. Additionally, 40 participants (11 from the control group, 18 from the family education group, and 11 from the center-based childcare and family education group) released information on the full-range biomedical sweep. Administrative crime data are not available for CARE. We do not evaluate the second-phase of treatment in CARE because it was not randomized.  Rather, those in the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group were offered school-age treatment, and those in the control group were not. 

\noindent In the following set of tables (Table~\ref{tab:abc_baseline} through Table~\ref{tab:health_baseline}), we compare the observed, baseline characteristics between the first-phase control and treatment groups in ABC, which are the main groups we analyze, at different stages of the data collection follow-ups. For each observed characteristic, we present the bootstrapped $p$-value associated with the standard $t$-test. We also present the bootstrapped, step-down $p$-value on jointly testing the difference in observed characteristics across the two blocks of variables separated by the horizontal line.\footnote{\citet{Lehmann_Romano_2005_testing}.}

\noindent First, we compare the first-phase treatment and control groups on baseline characteristics.

\noindent Finally, we compare the observed, baseline characteristics between the children in the first-phase treatment, restricting the sample to the children for whom we have information on the age-34 medical data collection.

\noindent Despite some exceptions, these tables indicate balance between the treatment and control groups from the first-phase randomization, which is the primary comparison we analyze in the main paper. The balance in observed characteristics holds for the different samples we consider, which differs from the initial sample due to various instances of item non-response. For the second-phase randomization, there is also balance in observed characteristics. 

\noindent Table \ref{tab:care_baseline2} through Table \ref{tab:health_baseline_care_t1} are the analogous tables for CARE. We compare the two treatment groups (center-based childcare and family education, and only family education) separately across the full sample and by cohort. The inference statistics are constructed using the same methods as for Table \ref{tab:abc_baseline} through Table \ref{tab:health_baseline}.
