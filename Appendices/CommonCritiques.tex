\section{Assessing Common Critiques to ABC} \label{appendix:assessingcc}

\noindent This section of the appendix assesses some of the critiques to ABC, which could apply to CARE as well. The critiques focus on the first phase of the program, to which we refer simply as ABC in this section of the appendix. We consider the following categories of critiques: (i) validity of treatment effects given early differences between treatment and control groups, (ii) fadeout of the treatment effect on cognitive outcomes, and (iii) compromised randomization. \\

\subsection{Treatment Effects vs. Early Differences Between Groups}

\noindent The first critique we assess is that of \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. The author asks if ABC prevented socio-cultural mental retardation. He focuses on different measures of cognition, and generically calls them IQ. His main focus is on the raw mean difference between the treatment and the control groups in the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Infant Behavior (BSID) at 1 year of age.\footnote{The Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) is a standard measure of cognition at taken between ages 0 and 2 \citep{Childrens-Health_2016_Bayley-Scales}.} He finds a noticeable disparity in the mean difference between cohorts 1 and 2 and cohorts 3 and 4, as early as six months after the treatment began. As \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} argues, this difference, displayed in Table~\ref{table:cohorts}, is conspicuous. Importantly, the author fails to note that the mean differences have noticeably high standard errors.

\input{output/abc_cohorts}

\noindent \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} states that ``an essential question is whether the differences at 6 months of age were due to the intervention or were preexisting'' \citep[][p. 230]{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} proceeds with speculative exercises that lead him to state that it is questionable to conclude that the mean difference between the treatment and control groups as early as 6 months of age is a consequence of the treatment.\footnote{The exact quote is: ``Even if the differences between experimental and control groups at 6 months of age were a consequence of the first few months of intervention, which is questionable, the negligible additional effects after age 4.5 more years in the program should at least make one cautious about this kind of intervention's potential [\ldots]'' \citep[][p. 235]{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. We assess the former point before getting to the latter.}\\

\noindent His argument stems from not receiving information on the maternal characteristics, which he considers fundamental for his analysis to comparing test scores over the years.\footnote{He does not note that tests scores \textit{do not have a well-defined scale} and are hard to compare.}\\

\noindent We present some annotations with respect to the comments in \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}.\\

\noindent \textbf{1. Mothers do not significantly differ in observed characteristics between the treatment and the control groups in any ABC cohort.} When jointly testing the hypothesis of differences in a battery of observed characteristics, we fail to reject any difference between the families of the subjects (see Table~\ref{tab:baseline_coh1} to Table~\ref{tab:baseline_coh4}). Even when the point estimates present some differences, they are minimal. For example, treatment-group mothers differ from control-group mothers, on average, by having one point higher IQ score (the population standard deviation is 15 points).\\

\noindent \textbf{2. Other early childhood education programs have generated gains in cognition very early in life, as soon as a year after the start of the program.} A more recent program, the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), treated children from ages 0 to 3. \citet{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth} thoroughly describe this program. A lot of its elements were based on ABC/CARE. The program offered, on average, eight hours a week of center-based childcare from ages 1 to 3, weekly home visits from ages 0 to 1, and bi-monthly home visits from ages 1 to 3. Measures of the Bayley MDI at 12 and 24 months are available. The most intensive part of the treatment, center-based childcare, began in IHDP at 12 months of age while it began in ABC at birth. As in ABC, after a few months of center-based childcare, the effects on cognition were substantial in IHDP.

\input{output/ihdp_bayley}

\noindent \textbf{3. The effects on cognition are sustained throughout childhood and up to age 21 even when partialing out the Bayley MDI at ages 12 and 24 months.} When partialing out from a linear regression the score in the Bayley MDI tests both at 12 and 24 months of age, the treatment effects on cognition, measured by the mean difference in IQ scores at different ages between the treatment and control groups, are still significant and are sustained up to age 21 (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatiqsabc}).

The line with circles represents the raw difference. The line with squares represents the difference when linearly controlling for the Bayley Mental Development Index at 12 and 24 months.}
\end{figure}

\noindent The author raises an additional concern. He states that even if the early-life effects on the Bayley MDI were valid, the effects were not long-lasting. When doing so, he exclusively refers to the effects the program had on cognition. As we document throughout the main paper, however, ABC had effects on a wide set of life-cycle outcomes, which perhaps are more important than the effects on cognition if measured by the economic gains they generate. Examples include: employment at age 30 for males, high-school graduation for females, and a variety of health measures at age 34 for males. We document these effects in the main paper.\\

\subsection{Fadeout of Treatment Effects}

\noindent This sustained effect on life-cycle outcomes relates to another category of criticism of ABC---the fadeout of treatment effects after the actual treatment period.\footnote{See, for example, \citet{Besharov-etal_2011_ABCProject}.} Based on the fadeout of the effects on cognition and age-21 outcomes, some studies claim that ABC had no sustained long-term effects. In addition to the evidence we cite above, it is important to add the following.\\

\noindent  \textbf{4. The treatment effects of ABC differed by gender.} For example, we find substantial effects on employment for males and high-school graduation for females. This does not mean that the program did not work. It means that market conditions could have affected the way in which the treated subjects benefited from the program's effects.\\

\subsection{Compromised Randomization}

\noindent The third and last critique we assess is that of compromised randomization.\footnote{See for example \citet{Baumeister-Bacharach_2000_Early-Generic} and the multiple studies cited there.} The main critique to the program in this respect is that seven children in the treatment group did not comply to their initial assignment and one subject switched from control to treatment status (see Table~\ref{table:abccompromises}, which we reproduce from the main paper). Although we document more cases of compromised randomization, we start by assessing these eight cases.\footnote{Our main methodology assesses all the cases except the four subjects for whom we do not have data at all. We are not able to account for them because our method is based on observing at least some baseline characteristics. See Section~\ref{section:methodology} in the main paper for more details.}\\

\noindent First, we propose a method to assess the non-compliance of six subjects for whom we have data available from ages 0 to 8. This allows for the possibility of adjusting the mean difference between the treatment and the control groups, using a standard Bloom estimator \citep{Bloom_1984_ER}. This estimator accounts for compliance, by weighting the mean difference by a measure of the probability of compliance. It takes the following form:

\begin{equation}
\Delta^{\textbf{Bloom}} = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right] }{\mathbb{E} \left[ D | R = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ D | R = 0 \right]},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ indicates randomization into treatment, $D$ indicates treatment take-up, and $Y$ is an outcome of interest.\\

\noindent This estimator coincides with the instrumental variable estimator of the parameter in a linear regression of an outcome on a single explanatory variable, e.g. treatment take-up. As \citet{Angrist_Imbens_ea_1996_JASA} show, under certain assumptions it can be interpreted as the average treatment effect for those individuals induced to take up treatment by the instrument. This interpretation has various weaknesses \citep{Heckman_Urzua_etal_2006_REStat,Heckman_Urzua_2010_JoE}.\\

\noindent To compare the mean difference and the Bloom estimator we consider two measures of cognition, which are commonly used when evaluating ABC and are available for these six subjects: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale at age 3 and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at age 5. Table~\ref{table:nc1} presents the results and shows that the differences are minimal. \textbf{5. Adjusting for the non-compliance of these six subjects makes little difference} when assessing outcomes that we observe for these subjects.

\input{output/abc_noncomp_e1}

\noindent Second, we propose a method to account for non-compliance of the four subjects for whom we have no data at all. We reproduce the estimates in Table~\ref{table:nc2}, assigning the lowest score across all the subjects in the treatment group to each of these four children. For each of the tests we consider, the lowest score was 71 for both the age-3 and the age-5 measures. \textbf{6. Even when assigning the lowest score to the subjects who did not comply to treatment and for whom no data are available, the mean difference between treatment and control is sizable and not significantly different from the baseline cases where we do not adjust for non-compliance cases} (columns (1) and (3) in Table~\ref{table:nc1}).

\input{output/abc_noncomp_e2}

\noindent Finally, we note that our methodology in Section~\ref{section:methodology} and the results we present in Section~\ref{section:results} account for the remainder of randomization compromises, as when the families moved or abandoned the study later on. \textbf{7. The results are not greatly sensitive to adjusting for the rest of the randomization compromises}, as we show in Section~\ref{section:results}.
