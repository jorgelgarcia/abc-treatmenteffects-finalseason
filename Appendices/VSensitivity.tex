\section{Alternative Definitions of Control Substitution and Two-Sided Statistical Tests} \label{appendix:vsensitivity}

\subsection{Alternative Definitions of Control Substitution}

\noindent In the main paper, we let $V$ be a dummy variable indicating whether or not the child attended alternative childcare arrangements. As we discuss in Section~\ref{section:background}, this dummy variable is a summary of a more complex reality in which children attend alternatives different months between ages 0 to 5. In this appendix, we explore three different alternative definitions of $V$: we let $V$ indicate if children attend alternatives (i) $2/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; (ii) $3/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; and (iii) $4/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5. For each of these cases, we present a summary table of treatment effects analogous to Table~\ref{table:tescombined} in the main paper.\\

\noindent The results are robust to different choices for modeling $V$. What matters is the extensive margin decision to enroll children into alternative childcare arrangements, and not the intensive margin decision of the number of months they attend between ages 0 to 5.

Each column present estimates for the following parameters: (1) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 -  \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0} \right]$ (no controls); (2) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 -  \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0} \right] $(controls); (3) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 | R = 1 \right] -  \mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^0 | R = 0,V = 0  \right]$ (no controls); (4) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 -  \bm{Y}_H^0 | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0} \right]$ (controls);  (5) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 | R = 1 \right] -  \mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^0 | R = 0,V = 1 \right]$ (no controls); (6) $\mathbb{E} \left [ \bm{Y}^1 -  \bm{Y}_C^0 | \bm{B} \in \mathcal{B}_{0} \right]$ (controls). We account for the following background variables ($\bm{B}$): Apgar scores at minutes 1 and 5 and the high-risk index. We define the high-risk index in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} and explain how we choose the control variables in Appendix~\ref{appendix:bvariables}. Columns (2), (4), and (6) correct for item non-response and attrition using inverse probability weighting as we explain in Appendix~\ref{app:method_partialobs}. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We highlight point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:vsensitivity} for two-sided $p$-values.

\subsection{Two-Sided Statistical Tests}

\noindent In the main paper, we classify the outcomes of interest as ``beneficial'' (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} our classification) and perform one-sided tests. The next table presents two-sided inferences for the main table of treatment-effect estimates in the main paper, Table~\ref{table:tescombined}. The main treatment effects survive two-sided testing. A full replication of the results throughout the main text using two-sided statistical tests is available under request. As is evident from the standard errors, our combining functions and cost-benefit analysis results generally survive two-sided testing.
