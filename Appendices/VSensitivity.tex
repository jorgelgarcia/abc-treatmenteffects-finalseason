\section{Sensitivity of Treatment Effects to the Definition of Control Substitution} \label{appendix:vsensitivity}

\noindent In the main paper, we let $V$ be a dummy variable indicating whether or not the child attended alternative preschool. As we show in Section~\ref{section:background}, this dummy variable is a summary of a more complex reality in which children attend alternative preschool different months between ages 0 to 5. In this appendix, we explore three different alternative definitions of $V$: we let $V$ indicate if children attend alternative preschool (i) $2/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; (ii) $3/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; and (iii) $4/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5. For each of these cases, we present a summary table of treatment effects analogous to Table~\ref{table:tescombined} in the main paper.\\

Note: This table shows the treatment effects for categories outcomes that are important for our benefit/cost analysis. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are measured in terms of mm Hg. Each column present estimates for the following parameters: \textbf{(1)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 - \bm{Y}^0 | W = 1]$; {\textbf{(2)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 - \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B}, W=1 \big]$}; {\textbf{(3)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 | \bm{B}, D=1 \big] - \mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B}, V=0, D=0 \big]$}; {\textbf{(4)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 - \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B}, V=0, W = 1 \big] $}; {\textbf{(5)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 | \bm{B}, D=1 \big] - \mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B}, V=1, D = 0 \big]$}; {\textbf{(6)} $\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{Y}^1 - \bm{Y}^0 | \bm{B}, V=1 , W = 1\big]$}. We account for the following background variables ($\bm{B}$): Apgar scores at minutes 1 and 5 and the high-risk index. We define the high-risk index in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} and explain how we choose the control variables in Appendix~\ref{appendix:bvariables}. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We highlight point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.
