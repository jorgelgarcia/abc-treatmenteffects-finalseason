\section{Gender Differences}
\label{appendix:genderdifferences}

We summarize (Table~\ref{tab:litreview-table}) work that examines early-life differences between boys and girls. It is generally found that boys are more fragile than girls early in life. While some of these papers consider the family environment, there is a dearth of work studying (1) the effect of low-quality preschool on children\footnote{Although \citet{Kottelenberg-Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects} study gender gaps, they only consider intact families.} and (2) the interaction of this with family environments. We find that while low-quality programs can deteriorate the parent-child interaction, especially for boys, high-quality programs can enhance it.

\subsection{Gender Differences in Treatment Effects}

The following tables report the gender differences between the control means and the treatment effects.
