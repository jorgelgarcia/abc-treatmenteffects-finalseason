\subsection{Survey of Gender Differences Literature}
\label{appendix:gdiff-survey}

We summarize (Table~\ref{tab:litreview-table}) work that examines early-life differences between boys and girls. It is generally found that boys are more fragile than girls early in life. While some of these papers consider the family environment, there is a dearth of work studying (1) the effect of low-quality preschool on children\footnote{Although \citet{Kottelenberg_Lehrer_2014_Gender-Effects} study gender gaps, they only consider intact families.} and (2) the interaction of this with family environments. We find that while low-quality programs can deteriorate the parent-child interaction, especially for boys, high-quality programs can enhance it.

\subsection{Proportion of Outcomes Males $>$ Females}

Tables~\ref{tab:proportion-table-home} and~\ref{tab:proportion-table-alt} compares ABC/CARE to subjects in the the control group who stay at home and attend alternative preschool, respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:proportion-fhome} partitions the data by whether the father is present.

A bold difference between treatment and control indicates that the rank sign test over 100 bootstraps yields a $p$-value less than or equal to 0.10.

Note: These plots show the proportion of outcomes, by outcome category, for which the males' mean is larger than the females' mean. The standard errors and the $p$-values are computed using 100 bootstraps. The $p$-values are one-sided and test the null hypothesis that the proportion of outcomes is greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ The crime outcomes are all coded so that a higher value indicates more criminal activity. All other outcome categories have higher values corresponding to socially desirable outcomes.
