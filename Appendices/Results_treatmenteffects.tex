\section{Procedures for Selecting Background Variables, Estimated Treatment Effects, and Estimated Combining Functions} \label{appendix:results}

\noindent In this appendix we first explain our method for selecting the background variables that we control for when estimating treatment effects.\footnote{This is a separate discussion from the election of variables to forecast life-cycle profiles of labor income and other outcomes. For that discussion see Appendix~\ref{appendix:methodology}.} Then, we present the treatment effects of the center-based treatment in ABC/CARE estimates for the 95 main outcomes we consider. For each set of estimates, we first present a summary of the effect of the program using a combining function counting the number of socially positive treatment effects. We then present tables of treatment effect estimates for each outcome. Finally, we test for statistically significant treatment effects using the step-down procedure to test multiple hypotheses.\\

\subsection{Background Variables} \label{appendix:bvariables}

\noindent We select three out of fourteen potential variables that best predict the relevant outcomes of interest, i.e. the outcomes we test treatment effects for. We list the fourteen variables in Table~\ref{tab:pselectvars} and bold the three we choose. In addition to these three variables, we account for a male indicator when computing estimates pooling males and females and a ABC/CARE indicator, to account for any difference in the programs---although we extensively document throughout the paper the similarities between them.

\noindent We briefly formalize the choice of the control sets based on most predictive models in the next lines.\\

\noindent Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of all the models we consider. In our application, $\mathcal{M}$ consists of all linear regressions of an outcome of interest on the different combinations of background variables. $m \in \mathcal{M}$ is one of such models. We choose the model minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) by ranking them according to their likelihood. That is, according to their posterior probability given the data. The data, in this case, are the dependent variable being predicted together with the background variables in each combination. We denote this by $\Pr( m | \text{Data} )$.\\

\pagebreak
\noindent Using Bayes Rule and the law of total probability,

\begin{eqnarray}
\Pr( m | \text{Data} ) &=& \frac{\Pr(\text{Data} | m)\times \Pr(m)}{ \Pr(\text{Data})}\\ \nonumber
&=& \frac{\Pr(\text{Data} | m)\times \Pr(m)}{\sum \limits _{m' \in M} \Pr (\text{Data} | m') \Pr(m')} \\ \nonumber
&\propto& \Pr (\text{Data} | m) \times \Pr(m),
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\Pr(m)$ is the prior probability of model $m$ and $\Pr(\text{Data} | m)$ is the probability of observing $\text{Data}$ under model $m$.\\

\noindent There are various approaches to rank the the likelihood of each model. Examples include rankings based on Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz), the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HWIC), and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We use the first approach because it has appealing consistency properties \citep{Diebold_2007_Forecasting}. This criterion minimizes the following loss function: $2 \log [\Pr( \text{Data} | m)]$. We follow an specific approximation developed by \citet{Claeskens-Hjort_2008_Model-Selection}, which assumes uniform priors and simplifies the computation of the loss function.\\

\noindent This procedure allows us to choose one control set per outcomes of interest. To gain consistency across all specifications, we sum the BIC across all outcomes and choose the background variables with lower average across models. These background variables form our control set across all estimations and appear bold in Table~\ref{tab:pselectvars}.\\

\subsubsection{Matching Variables}\label{app:matching-is-fun}

\noindent We use matching estimators for different versions of the ``treatment vs. stay at home'' and ``treatment vs. alternative preschools'' parameters. For treatment vs. stay at home, we construct the Mahalanobis distance between the individuals in the treatment group and the control group who stay at home and use an Epanechnikov metric to construct an individual-level weight---giving a relatively high weight to individuals in the treatment group who would have been likely to stay at home if randomized to the control group. We proceed analogously when estimating the treatment vs. alternative preschool parameters. We use the same variables to ``match'' and to ``control''.\\

\noindent Other forms of matching estimates such as propensity score matching and nearest neighbor(s) give very similar results and are available upon request. We analyze sensitivity to the choice of controls and matching variables next.\\

\subsubsection{Sensitivity Analysis} \label{app:senscontrols}

\noindent An immediate route of inquiry has to do with the sensitivity of our estimates to the choice of background variables. Especially in the context of our small sample, in which estimates can vary to different model specifications. To investigate this, we estimate treatment effects for the three counterfactuals we consider using all possible control sets for the three variables we can form with the background variables in Table~\ref{tab:pselectvars}. We also consider all possible control sets of one and two variables in Table~\ref{tab:pselectvars}. For brevity, we present this exercise for two outcomes, employment and education. Similar exercises for the 95 main outcomes we consider are available upon request.\\

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:senstnb} to Figure~\ref{fig:senstap} display the results from this exercise. In any case, the support of the distributions are very compressed leading us to conclude that there is little sensitivity to the choice of controls sets. This is especially true for the comparisons of treatment vs. staying at home and vs. alternative preschool.

\subsection{Outcomes of Interest}

\noindent Table \ref{tab:main-outcomes} lists the 95 main outcomes that we test in our main analysis. We reverse the outcomes for which we consider a negative treatment effect socially positive. \\

\subsection{Estimates} \label{appendix:estimates}

\noindent Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts} shows that across all methods of estimation, pooling males and females, over 70\% of the treatment effect estimates are beneficial. When using a 10\% statistical significance level, almost 40\% of all estimates are beneficial. These statistics allow us to reject the hypothesis that there are no treatment effects. \\

\noindent For both males and females, we find positive effects in IQ test scores, achievement test scores, as well as educational attainment. Males also enjoy additional benefits in the areas of employment, labor earnings, and hypertension. \\

\noindent In each of the tables for combining functions and treatment effect estimates, we present 8 different estimates. Column (1) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to. Column (2) adjusts the estimates in (1) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (3) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, restricting the latter to subjects who did not receive preschool alternatives. Column (4) adjusts the estimates in (3) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (5) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, placing a relatively high weight on the subjects who are likely not to be enrolled in alternative preschools. Column (6) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, restricting the latter to subjects who received preschool alternatives. Column (7) adjusts the estimates in (6) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (8) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, placing a relatively high weight on the children who are likely to be enrolled in alternative preschools. The results in bold are statistically significant at the 10\% level in a single-sided, non-parametric, bootstrapped test.\footnote{For the tables that present categorical combining function statistics that count the number of positive treatment effects that are significant at the 10\% level, two bootstrap tests are conducted. The first bootstrap test is used to determine significance at the 10\% level for each treatment effect. The second bootstrap test is used to determine whether the combined function statistic is significantly different from 10\% at the  10\% level. See Appendix~\ref{appendix:bootstrap} for more details on our inference procedures.} Columns (5) and (8) are standard kernel matching estimates. \\

\noindent Beginning with Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_cat0}, we display treatment effects by outcome. We divide the tables by different blocks of related outcomes. able~\ref{table:treatfactors} summarizes treatment effects on the set of selected``latent'' outcomes that we estimate. We display the full set of estimates beginning with Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_cat0}, together with the corresponding outcomes underlying the latents that we estimate.

%In each table we also present one or two factors constructed with the methodology in Appendix~\ref{app:endogeneity}. The idea behind doing this is to recover a ``latent'' outcome summarizing the outcomes in the table (e.g., latent IQ across IQ from ages 2 to 5). That is, measure the latent outcome using outcomes at various ages as measures of this latent. Testing for treatment effects on this factor it is yet another alternative to summarize treatment effects across a block of outcomes. T

We define the high-risk index in Appendix~\ref{appendix:background} and explain how we choose the control variables in Appendix~\ref{appendix:bvariables}. Inference is based on non-parametric, one-sided $p$-values from the empirical bootstrap distribution. We highlight point estimates significant at the $10\%$ level.

\subsection{Alternative Definitions of Control Substitution and Two-Sided Statistical Tests} \label{appendix:vsensitivity}

\subsubsection{Alternative Definitions of Control Substitution}
\label{appendix:vsensitivity-controlsub}

\noindent In the main paper, we let $V$ be a dummy variable indicating whether or not the child attended alternative childcare arrangements. As we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:data}, this dummy variable is a summary of a more complex reality in which children attend alternatives different months between ages 0 to 5. In this appendix, we explore three different alternative definitions of $V$: we let $V$ indicate if children attend alternatives (i) $2/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; (ii) $3/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5; and (iii) $4/5$ of the time between ages 0 to 5. For each of these cases, we present a summary table of treatment effects analogous to Tables~\ref{table:tescombinedmales} and \ref{table:tescombinedfemales} in the main paper.\\

\noindent The results are robust to different choices for modeling $V$. What matters is the extensive margin decision to enroll children into alternative childcare arrangements, and not the intensive margin decision of the number of months they attend between ages 0 to 5.

\subsubsection{Two-Sided Statistical Tests}
\label{app:vsensitivity-twosided}

\noindent In the main paper, we classify the outcomes of interest as ``beneficial'' (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:results} our classification) and perform one-sided tests. The next table presents two-sided inferences for the main table of treatment-effect estimates in the main paper, Tables~\ref{table:tescombinedmales} and \ref{table:tescombinedfemales}. The main treatment effects survive two-sided testing. A full replication of the results throughout the main text using two-sided statistical tests is available under request. As is evident from the standard errors, our combining functions and cost-benefit analysis results generally survive two-sided testing.
