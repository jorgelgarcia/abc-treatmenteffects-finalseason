\section{ABC and CARE Estimates}

\noindent We analyze 95 outcomes when combining the ABC and CARE samples. Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts} shows that across all methods of estimation, pooling males and females, over 70\% of the treatment effect estimates are socially positive. When conditioning on 10\% statistical significance, almost 40\% of all estimates are socially positive. These statistics allow us to reject the hypothesis that the treatment and control groups have the same marginal distributions in outcomes. \\

\noindent For both males and females, we find positive effects in IQ test scores, achievement test scores, as well as educational attainment. Males also enjoy additional benefits in the areas of employment, labor earnings, and hypertension. \\
