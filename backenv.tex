	\begin{itemize}
		\item \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE} roughly calculate a benefit-cost ratio for Head Start between $1.50$ and $1.84$ using the following method
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Calculate the treatment effect on WPPSI at age 5 for the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS)
			\item Monetize this treatment effect using calculations from \citet{Chetty_Friedman_etal_2010_HowDoesYour} that indicate a gain of 1 standard deviation in WPPSI at age 5 implies a $12.1\%$ increase in the net present value of earnings at age 27
			\item Calculate the benefit-cost ratio by dividing this monetized treatment effect by the total costs of the program 
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}

		\item We perform three exercises related to the exercise in \citet{Kline-Walters_2016_QJE}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The exact same exercise with the treatment effect of ABC/CARE on WPPSI at age 5
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Benefit-cost ratio: 0.45}
			\end{itemize}
			\item The same exercise but using the net present value of life-cycle earnings beyond age 27
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Benefit-cost ratio: 1.48}
			\end{itemize}
			\item The same exercise but using the net present value of all life-cycle components that are monetized in this paper
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Benefit-cost ratio: 5.15}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
