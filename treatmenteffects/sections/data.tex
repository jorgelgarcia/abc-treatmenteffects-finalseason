We combine the datasets from ABC and CARE. Table~\ref{tab:abc-care-characteristics} summarizes the characteristics of the programs. Both interventions were implemented by researchers at the Frank Porter Graham Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ABC had four cohorts of subjects born between 1972 and 1977, and CARE had two cohorts of subjects born between 1978 and 1980. Both interventions targeted children from disadvantaged families in the Chapel Hill area. Eligibility was determined based on a High Risk Index (HRI) developed for ABC and minimally adapted for CARE. Example components of the HRI include father's presence, parental employment, and welfare receipt.\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{app:program} for the full HRI. \citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty}.}

Both interventions involved intensive center-based care for subjects in the treatment group starting at 8 weeks and continuing until age 5 before the children started kindergarten. Treatment-group subjects also received daily health screenings and diapers and formula until 6 months. Control-group families received the diapers and formula as well for the same period of time.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.}  After school entrance until age 8, there was an additional component of treatment in which home visitors worked with children and their parents to tutor the children and to encourage families to be involved in the children's academics.\footnote{In ABC, treatment status of this component was randomized. In CARE, all the subjects who received center-based care also received this school-age component.} We do not consider this part of the treatment because it extends beyond early childhood and it was not found to have significant treatment effects.\footnote{\citet{Campbell_Ramey_etal_2002_ADS}.} 

The pedagogical approach focused on language development. During ABC and CARE, the \textit{Learning Games} curriculum was developed and refined.\footnote{\citet{Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree}.} ABC and CARE subjects engaged with this in addition to other curricula that emphasized child-led learning of language skills.\footnote{\citet{Conti_etal_2016_LongTermHealth}.}

CARE included an additional arm of treatment. In addition to the services listed above, those in the treatment group received home visiting from birth to age 5. This home visiting consisted of biweekly visits focusing on parental problem solving skills. There was an additional experimental group that received this home visiting component, but not the center-based care.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} We do not include this last group in our analysis due to few treatment effects from just the home visiting component. We also use this lack of treatment effects to justify merging the treatment groups of ABC and CARE, even though that of CARE received the additional home-visiting component.\footnote{This merging of ABC and CARE is similarly justified in \citet{Garcia_etal_2016_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.}

The control groups of both ABC and CARE had alternative preschool options. Documentation indicates that although these options were of lower quality than the center-based treatment, they were well-attended with about 75\% of the ABC/CARE control-group subjects were enrolled in these alternative preschools.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev,Garcia_etal_2016_Comp_CBA_Unpublished}.}

Table~\ref{tab:abccare-baseline} compares pre-program variables between experimental and gender groups. The only significant difference is seen in the HRI score, which is 1.78 points lower for males than for females. This indicates that males were slightly less advantaged at baseline. However, we do not account for multiple hypotheses meaning that with an $\alpha$ level of 10\%, we would expect, on average, one significant result out of ten hypotheses.\footnote{\citet{Romano_Wolf_2005_JASA}.}

\item Note: The variables in this table are all measured at the baseline age, close to when the children were born. A larger HRI (High Risk Index) score indicates more disadvantage. Apgar, measured at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, is a test of the health condition of newborn babies. A score closer to 10 indicates a healthier condition \citep{Apgar_1966_APGAR-Scoring_PCNA}. Birthweight is in pounds and gestational age is in weeks.

Figure~\ref{fig:family-over-time} complements Table~\ref{tab:abccare-baseline} by showing the evolution of the family characteristics during and after treatment, by gender. Conditional on the father being present at baseline, the his presence is fairly constant through age 8. The females in the treatment group have fewer present father than all the other groups.

Data across a wide range of outcomes were collected for ABC and CARE at similar time points. Table~\ref{tab:abc-care-data} summarizes the data collection for both programs. A varied battery of measures of cognitive, social-emotional, and parenting skills were administered during the intervention and while the children were in school. Adult follow-ups are available at ages 21, 30, and 34, with administrative crime records and biomarker health data available at age 34.
