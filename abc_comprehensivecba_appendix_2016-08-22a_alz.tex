\section[Background]{Background\footnote{This section of the appendix is based on joint work with Sylvi Kuperman.}} \label{appendix:background}

\subsection{Overview}

\noindent The Carolina Abecedarian Project (ABC) and the Carolina Approach to Responsive Education (CARE) were high-quality early childhood education programs each with two phases of randomized controlled design. They were both implemented at the Frank Porter Graham Center (FPGC) of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. ABC served four cohorts of children born between 1972 and 1977, and CARE served two cohorts of children born between 1977 and 1980. In the main paper, we explain the eligibility requirements, the randomization protocol, and the programmatic contents of both programs. In this section of the appendix, we expand on additional important details of all these aspects.

\subsection{Eligibility Criteria and Populations Served}

\noindent The mothers of the ABC and CARE subjects were typically recruited during the last trimester  of pregnancy. Potential families were referred by local social service agencies and hospitals. Eligibility was determined by a score of 11 or more on a weighted 13-factor High-risk Index (HRI).\\

\noindent The HRI for ABC was based on 13 weighted variables, which are listed here with weights in parentheses: (i) maternal education level measured by years of education--- 6 (8), 7 (7), 8 (6), 9 (3), 10 (2), 11 (1), 12 (0); (ii) paternal education level with weights identical to those for maternal education; (iii) yearly family income measured in current dollars---\$1,000 or less (8), \$1,001-\$2000 (7), \$2,001-\$3,000 (6), \$3,001-\$4,000 (5), \$4,001-\$5,000 (4), \$5,001-\$6,000 (0); (iv) father's absence from the household for reasons other than health or death (3); (v) lack of maternal relatives in the area (3); (vi) siblings of school age one or more grades behind age-appropriate level, or with equivalently low scores on school-administered achievement tests (3); (vii) received payments from welfare agencies within the past 3 years (3); (viii) record of father's work indicates instability or unskilled and semi-skilled labor (3); (ix) record of maternal or paternal IQ score of 90 or below (3); (x) record of a sibling with an IQ score of 90 or below (3); (xi) relevant social agencies in the community indicate the family is in need of assistance (3); (xii) one or more family members has sought counseling or professional help in the past 3 years (1); and (xiii) special circumstances not included in any of the above that are likely contributors to cultural or social disadvantage (1).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_Campbell_1984_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Ramey_Campbell_etal_2000_ADS}.} The weighting scale aimed to establish the relative importance of each item in the index.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD}.} Race was not  considered for eligibility; however, 98\% of the families who agreed to participate were African-American.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.} \\

\noindent The HRI for CARE was similar to that of ABC---it also contained 13 weighted variables and a score of 11 or above was required to be considered eligible. The items for maternal and paternal education levels have the same categories and weights as the ABC HRI. The other identical items are having an absent father,  school-age siblings performing lower than the norm based on grade-level or achievement tests, a record of father's unstable job history or unskilled labor, social agencies indicating a high level of need, and other circumstances related to cultural or social disadvantage. The specification of the following items were changed between the ABC and CARE HRI. The weight associated with household income depended on the number of individuals in the family for CARE and the income categories range from less than \$2,000 to \$13,500 or more. In the CARE HRI, it is asked if payments were received from welfare agencies in the past 5 years instead of the past 3 years. Similarly, it asks if any family member has sought counseling in the past 5 years instead of the past 3 years. The threshold for maternal or paternal IQ is 85 in the CARE HRI instead of 90 as in the ABC HRI.  It does not have an item related to the absence of maternal relatives in the area, but replaces that item with asking if any member of the mother or father's immediate family has received services for the mentally disabled (the weight for this item is 3).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}

\noindent Figure~\ref{figure:hridistabc} and Figure~\ref{figure:hridistcare} display the distribution of the HRI score among all subjects in ABC and CARE, respectively. All subjects were substantially disadvantaged. Maternal age when the subject was born was, on average, 19.9 years in ABC and 21.1 years in CARE. Approximately half of the mothers of both treatment-group and control-group subjects in ABC were 19 years or younger and one third were 17 years or younger. In CARE, approximately half of the mothers of both treatment-group and control-group subjects were 20 years or younger and one third were 17.2 years or younger.  Mean maternal IQ score in ABC was approximately 85, one standard deviation below the national mean. In CARE, the mean maternal IQ score was approximately 87. Only 25\% of the ABC subjects lived with both biological parents, and more than 50\% lived with extended families in multi-generational households (61\% of treatment-group subjects and 56\% of control-group subjects).\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.} About 79\% of subjects did not have a father in the home in both ABC and CARE. \\

\subsection{Randomization Protocol and Compromises} \label{appendix:randomization}

\noindent Randomization compromises throughout ABC's and CARE's implementations pose a challenge when evaluating the programs' effects. We discuss each case of compromise in detail. Figure~\ref{fig:abc-flow} and Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} are flow charts that depict the sample from the first-phase randomization through the last data follow-up accounting for all cases of attrition and non-compliance. In Section~\ref{section:methodology},  we propose a methodology for adequately evaluating the programs while accounting for these compromises.\\

\noindent Although most randomization compromises occurred at early stages, this methodology also accounts for the fact that a few subjects were not in the sample either for the second-phase randomization or for the adult follow-ups. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}, we describe the sample reductions that attrition at different stages of the study generates and test potential differences between the subjects who completed data follow-ups and the subjects who did not.\\

\subsubsection{ABC}

\noindent Both the first and second phases of randomization were conducted at the family level, so pairs of siblings and twins were jointly randomized into either treatment or control groups.\footnote{Sibling pairs occurred when the two siblings were close enough in age such that both of them were eligible for the program.} Although we know that pairing was based on HRI, maternal IQ, maternal education, maternal age, and gender of the subject, we do not know the original pairs. The study collected an initial sample of 120 families. Twenty-two subjects did not complete the first-phase of treatment as initially assigned by the randomization (see Table~\ref{table:abccompromises}).\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:controls}, we compare the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:abccompromises} to the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.}\\


\noindent Of these cases, there were four subjects assigned to treatment who left the study before any data on them was collected. In our main methodology, we assume that they are missing at random. Exercises assuming that these subjects had outcomes identical to the subject with the lowest outcome in the treatment group suggest that, even in this extreme scenario, there is little sensitivity (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc}).\\

\noindent Second, four subjects died before age 5---two of them initially assigned to treatment and two of them initially assigned to control. For all of them, we observe baseline characteristics and any other data collected before their death. For methodological purposes, they represent cases of program attrition when we do not observe their outcomes.\\

\noindent Third, three subjects in the treatment group did not comply to treatment status. They are different from the four subjects who left the study before any data collection because we observe data collected for them from birth to age 8. Afterward, the program staff chose not to follow them anymore.\footnote{Informal conversations with the program's staff do not indicate a clear reason for this.} Therefore, these subjects remain in treatment sample until age 8 or before. After, they represent cases of program attrition, given that we do not observe them anymore. In Appendix~\ref{appendix:assessingcc} we find little sensitivity to adjusting for non-compliance of these children in the results we show for age 8 or before.\\

\input{output/abc_compromises}

\noindent Fourth, one subject initially assigned to control was enrolled into treatment. Her mother wanted to work and the program staff decided to admit her child into center-based care.\footnote{Correspondence with the program officers stating this permission is available under request from the authors.} Both in terms of data collection and in terms of methodological purposes, this subject is analogous to the subjects in the third case.\footnote{The sensitivity analysis finding little evidence when adjusting for non-compliance includes this case.}\\

\noindent Fifth, four subjects in the treatment group did not complete treatment in its entirety. They were treated for 3, 10, 6, and 9 months, respectively. Except for follow-ups during childhood, which our main results do not use, we observe most of the data for these subjects. We avoid taking a stance on how beneficial the program was at each age, because we do not have a way to document this. Therefore, we assume that they were treated as other subjects in the treatment group.\footnote{If anything, this downward biases the effects of the program we estimate.} \\

\noindent Sixth, the family of one subject in the control group moved at age 54 months. We observe any data collection before the family moved, so we consider the subject as part of the control group in any estimation before this event. Afterwards, we do not observe any data on the subject, so we consider her a case of program attrition.\\

\noindent Seventh, two subjects initially assigned to treatment status were diagnosed as developmentally delayed after 6 and 36 months of treatment. No data for them are available after the diagnosis. We drop them from the sample because they were not eligible to be part of the program.\\

\noindent Finally, two subjects initially assigned to the control group were admitted into treatment. Local authorities requested this because the children were considered highly at risk. Data on them are available from birth to age 8 and we treat them as the subjects in the third and fourth cases. They crossed over from the control group to the treatment group, although the reasons were different.\\

\noindent Analysis of each of these cases leads to the following conclusions. For four subjects, we do not have data to methodologically assess them as cases of program attrition, though sensitivity analyses suggest that the treatment effects of the program persist after assigning them the same outcome as the subjects who did the worst in the treatment group. For the subjects who did not comply to treatment, adjusting our estimates for non-compliance when data are available makes little difference. The remaining 14 subjects who did not complete treatment as initially assigned represent various cases of program attrition, for which we propose a correction methodology in Section~\ref{section:methodology}.\\

\noindent To increase the number of subjects in the sample, the program officers recruited additional subjects who were added to the program before the subjects were 6 months old. Our calculations indicate that there were eight replacements. We cannot distinguish in the data the subjects who were initially randomized from the replacement children and there is no documentation on how these subjects were recruited.\footnote{Three replacements are reported in \citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}. Three are documented in correspondence with the program officers, which is available from the authors of the present document upon request. The other two replacements are implied by the number of subjects who participated of the randomization protocol in each cohort.} After the various compromises, the sample consisted of 111 subjects: 53 in the treatment group and 58 in the control group. The observed characteristics for each subjects indicate that they were eligible for the program; all subjects in the sample have an HRI of 11 or above. \\

\noindent Prior to the second phase of randomization, 3 subjects in the first-phase control group and 3 subjects in the first-phase treatment group could not be located for follow-up. One subject in the control group and eight subjects in the treatment group of the first phase did not participate in the second phase but later agreed to participate in the data collections during adulthood. This yielded a sample of 96 subjects in the second phase: 49 in treatment and 47 in control. After the second-phase randomization, three subjects in the treatment group chose not to participate in the program, while all subjects in the control group adhered to their randomization status. \\

\subsubsection{CARE}

\noindent The randomization protocol in CARE had no major compromises.\footnote{\citet{Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD,Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} Of the 65 initial families, 23 were randomized to a control group, 25 to the family education treatment group, and 17 to the family education and center-based childcare treatment group. Two families in the family education treatment group had twins who were jointly randomized, as in ABC. We document four cases of program attrition (see Table~\ref{table:care_compromises}).\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{appendix:controls}, we compare the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects in Table~\ref{table:care_compromises} to the observed baseline characteristics of the subjects who complied to the initial treatment assignment. We find little evidence of differences.} For methodological purposes, we consider these subjects analogous to their corresponding cases in ABC. We do not present exercises to evaluate the sensitivity to non-compliance because there was none in CARE. Figure~\ref{fig:care-flow} illustrates CARE's randomization protocol and the presence of subjects throughout the data follow-ups.\\

\subsection{Program Description and Content}

\subsubsection{Goals}
\noindent The original goals of treatment were to prevent mental retardation\footnote{Note that the clinical understanding of mental retardation was once associated with disadvantages that hindered early-life development \citep{Mental-Retardation_America_2004_BOOK_NYU}.} by enhancing overall development from birth, in turn fostering school-readiness for an at-risk population. Additional curriculum goals were to (i) support language, motor, and cognitive development; (ii) minimize high-risk behaviors; and (iii) develop socio-emotional competencies considered crucial for school success including task-orientation, communicative competence, independence, and prosocial behavior.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Ramey-etal_2012-ABC}.} Implementation of ABC's and CARE's educational treatments evolved each successive year as program staff evaluated ongoing outcome data.\footnote{ \citet{Ramey-etal_1975_AJoMD, Finkelstein_1982_Day_Care_YC, McGinness_1982_Language-Poverty-Child,Haskins_1985_CD}.}\\


\subsubsection{Daily Schedule}
\noindent For both ABC and CARE, FPGC was open to families from 7:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., 5 days per week and 50 weeks per year.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} Subjects were offered free transportation to and from the center. A driver and second adult staffed each vehicle (one van and two station wagons) equipped with child safety seats.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Data provided by FPGC indicate that approximately 65\% of treated ABC families utilized the free transportation.\footnote{\citet{Barnett_Masse_2002_benefitcost}.} Vehicles typically arrived by 9:00 a.m. to the center and departed around 3:45 p.m.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} At FPGC, ABC and CARE treatment-group subjects received breakfast, lunch, and a snack planned by a nutritionist.\footnote{ \citet{Haskins_1985_CD, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} Meals were catered by off-site kitchens. Infants received iron-fortified formula  until doctors advised adding solid food. The control-group subjects also received an unlimited amount of iron-fortified formula until approximately 15 months of age.\footnote{\citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,abc2014-2015interviews}.}\\

\subsubsection{Program Staff and Physical Space}
\noindent To promote trust in FPGC within the sample families, staff were recruited from the local community.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Feagans_1996_Childrens-Talk,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Infant and toddler caregivers and preschool teachers demonstrated varied educational backgrounds ranging from high school graduation to master's degrees. Their average professional working experience with young children was 7 years.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD}.} All classroom staff participated in extensive training and were closely observed by FPGC's academic staff, as part of a broad variety of ongoing clinical and social research related to early childhood education, psychology, and health. In ABC, child-caregiver ratios varied by age: 3:1 for infants up to 13 to 15 months of age; 4:1 for toddlers up to 36 months; and 5:1 or 6:1 for children aged 3 to 5 years, depending on cohort size.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach}.} Child-caregiver ratios were similar in CARE.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}\\

\noindent The ABC and CARE staff included a program director, a secretary, 12 to 14 teachers and assistant teachers, 3 administrative staff members, and a transportation supervisor.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} Lead caregivers and teachers had bachelor's or master's degrees. Teacher aides, recruited from the local community, held high school diplomas (at minimum) and were comparatively well-compensated in the childcare field. They remained a stable treatment component throughout the study. After 1980, following revisions to FIDCR regarding minimum requirements for early childhood education staff, several teacher aides pursued and received undergraduate degrees and became lead teachers. All classroom staff were supervised daily, received weekly mentoring, and professional development from outside consultants..\footnote{\citet{Obrien-Sanders_1974_ABC-brochure, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE, Sanders-Stokes_1979_Status-Report,Klein-Sanders_1982_Status-Report,abc2014-2015interviews}.}\\

\noindent Infant nurseries, toddler rooms, and preschool classrooms were housed on different floors of FPGC. Early reports indicate that FPGC allocated two floors to ABC, but later reports indicate the use of three floors.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_1981_Modification}.} Two infant nurseries were staffed by five adults in a suite of four adjoining rooms: two sleeping rooms contained seven cribs each, while the other two rooms were designated for activities.\footnote{ \citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC}.} The four rooms opened into a large, shared space with feeding tables, an area for food preparation, and a couch.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.} Offices for the medical staff, along with two examining rooms and facilities for laboratory tests were located around the corner from the infant nurseries.\footnote{\citet{abc2014-2015interviews}.} Two multi-age toddler rooms were located one floor below the infant nurseries. One room served children who were 1 to 2 years old and the other served children 2 to 3 years old.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR}.} 3-year-olds were housed in a closed classroom near the toddler rooms. On the lowest floor, 4-year-olds shared an open classroom with a public kindergarten program; the two classes were separated by a long, low bookcase. In CARE, two floors of FPGC were allocated to nurseries and classrooms. A mixed-age classroom design was implemented combining children ages 1 and 3, and children ages 2 and 4. Teacher-child ratios for these ages remained 1:5. FPGC offered two outdoor play areas for both ABC and CARE: one for children up to age 3, and the other for older children.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR,Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach}.}\\

\subsubsection{Approach to Child Development}
%Direct from the paper
\noindent Curriculum delivery enabled a highly customized learning experience for treated subjects in both ABC and CARE. Infant caregivers recorded child observations on progress charts and collaborated with FPGC's curriculum developers and academic researchers to rotate learning activities every 2 to 3 weeks for each treated subject.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.} Preschool rooms featured intentionally organized environments to promote pre-literacy and access to a rich set of learning tools. The full-day curriculum emphasized active learning experiences, dramatic play, and pre-academics. Frequent 1:1 or 2:1 child-adult interactions prioritized language development for social competence. For ages 3 through 5, as the cohorts approached public school entry, classroom experiences were increasingly structured  towards the development of pre-academic skills and ``socio-linguistic and communicative competence.''\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Haskins_1985_CD, Ramey_1981_Modification, Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_Smith_1977_AJMD, Ramey_McGinness_etal_1982_Abecedarianapproach, Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree,Sparling_Lewis_1984_BOOKLearningGamesThreesFours}.} FPGC offered a summer program before the start of kindergarten designed to target specific skills to ensure success in a kindergarten classroom (e.g., lining up when exiting the classroom). This program was available to subjects in both the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.} \\

\noindent ABC's and CARE's learning programs were influenced by key developmental theorists, including Bowlby, Piaget, Vygotsky, and Tough.\footnote{\citet{Sparling_1974_Synth_Edu_Infant_SPEECH,Mcginness_1981_Developing,abc2014-2015interviews}.} All four ABC cohorts and two CARE cohorts participated in curriculum developers Sparling and Lewis' ``Learningames for the First Three Years.''\footnote{ \citet{Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree}.} The ``Learningames'' were implemented daily by infant and toddler caregivers in 1:1 child-adult interactions. Each ``Learningames'' activity stated a developmentally-appropriate objective, the necessary materials, directions for teacher behavior, and expected child outcome. The activities were designed for use both indoors and outdoors, while dressing, eating, bathing, or during play.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_1981_Modification,Sparling_Lewis_1979_BOOKLearninggamesFirstThree}.}\\

\noindent Supplemental curricula for preschool rooms varied throughout the study, and included ``Cook and Learn,'' ``Peabody Early Experiences Kit,'' ``GOAL Math Program,'' and ``My Friends and Me.''\footnote{ \citet{Greenberg_Epstein_1973_BOOKBridgestoreading,Karnes1973,Dunn_Chun_etal_1976_BOOKPeabodyearlyeducation,Davis_1977_BOOKMyfriends,Wallach_1976_Teaching-All-Children}.}
%SK notes to co-authors: I'm currently waiting for info from Lynne Vernon-Feagans to potentially include a social worker to the list of staff!

\noindent CARE subjects randomized into the center-based childcare and family education group or the family education group also received home visits designed to transmit information on child development and skills involved with parenting including strategies for parent-child interactions based on ``Learningames" activities and problem-solving techniques.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} Home visitors were trained to ensure they were able to form a strong relationship with the parent and successfully implement the curriculum.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The visits lasted about an hour, and occurred weekly until the child was 3 years old. After age 3, the home visits were less frequent and depended on the preferences of the parents. They were usually about once a month after age 3.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Wasik_Ramey_etal_1990_CD, Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.}

\subsubsection{Medical Care and Nutrition}
%Direct from the paper
ABC and CARE provided comprehensive on-site medical care because it was conducted in conjunction with a longitudinal medical research study on infectious respiratory diseases in group environments.\footnote{\citet{Henderson-et-al_1982_NEJoM}.} Treatment group children were monitored daily for signs of illness. All treated children received medical care while attending center-based childcare; the first ABC cohort of control-group children also received medical care during the program's first year of implementation.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty,Campbell_Ramey_1994_CD}.}$^{,}$\footnote{Subjects in both the treatment and control groups of the first cohort received free medical care provided by ABC. The control group of the first cohort only received medical care in the first year of the program; the treatment group of the first cohort received medical care for all years of the program. In the subsequent cohorts, only subjects in the treatment group received free medical care provided by ABC. Both CARE cohorts of treated subjects received medical care.}\\

\noindent In ABC, primary pediatric care was provided by a family nurse practitioner and a licensed practical nurse, both under the supervision of one pediatrician who was on continuous duty at the center.\footnote{\citet{Haskins-et-al_1978_JoPP}.} In CARE, the medical staff included two pediatricians, a family nurse practitioner, and a licensed practical nurse.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The medical staff provided regularly scheduled check-ups, immunizations, parental counseling, and initial assessment of illnesses.\footnote{\citet{Ramey-et-al_1977_Intro-to-ABC, Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE}.} The treatment group received standard check-ups when they were 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months old and annually thereafter. While in treatment, they also received the standard immunizations.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}.} In ABC, a licensed practical nurse visited classrooms for up to two hours on a daily basis to monitor the subjects' health status.\footnote{\citet{Sanyal_Henderson_etal_1980_JoPediatrics}.} Although this medical care was offered to the treatment-group families free of charge, it was the policy of the medical staff to refer families to a community hospital for serious treatment. While ABC and CARE provided aspirin, immunizations, and basic medicines, families were responsible for purchasing any prescription medication subjects required. There are no data currently available on treatment received for serious conditions or use of prescription medication.  \\

\noindent Infants were supplied with iron-fortified formula. Children older than 15 months of age were provided breakfast, lunch, and an
afternoon snack all planned by a nutritionist.\footnote{\citet{Bryant_et_al_1987_Carolina_Approach_TIECSE, Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments,abc2014-2015interviews}.} Control families received diapers for up to three years and unlimited iron-fortified bottled formula through 15 months.\footnote{\citet{Ramey_Collier_etal_1976_CarolinaAbecedarianProject,Ramey_Campbell_1979_SR, Ramey_etal_1985_Project-CARE_TiECSE}.}

\subsubsection{School-age Treatment}

\noindent The ABC subjects participated in a second-phase randomization into a school-age treatment (95 subjects continued to this stage of treatment). The CARE subjects in the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group received the school-age treatment without randomization. The school-age treatment lasted for the first three years of elementary school and consisted of home visits conducted by a Home/School Resource Teacher.\footnote{\cite{Burchinal_Campbell_etal_1997_CD}.} These visits were structured to increase exposure to reading and mathematics and promote parental involvement in the academic process.\\

\noindent The curriculum was delivered through sets of activities (around 60 per year) that developed skills such as handwriting, phonics, and math facts.\footnote{\cite{Campbell-Ramey_1989_Preschool-vs-School-age}.} Teachers worked to encourage parental involvement in the subjects' academics and provided incentives to families to comply with the treatment, such as giving gift certificates to restaurants and books for the subjects upon the completion of activity packets. Home activities were designed at the appropriate level to promote success.\\

\noindent Teachers had graduate-level education, training in special education, \textit{or} were qualified to act as consultants for in-school teachers to address any problems that arose.\footnote{\cite{Ramey_Campbell_1991_childreninpoverty}.} They met with parents at home and with teachers in the schools to deliver new activities for them to complete with their children and discuss the child's level of success with the previous set of activities. In addition, they helped parents with issues such as adult literacy, housing, and medical care. Thus, the teacher had a dual role as a parent educator and an advocate for the subject in their educational institution.

\subsection{Control Substitution}

\noindent In ABC, the families of almost $70\%$ of the control-group subjects enrolled their children in high-quality childcare. In CARE, $74\%$ of families in the control group and $62\%$ of families in the family education group enrolled their children in high-quality childcare. We refer to this phenomenon as control substitution; accounting for it is fundamental when evaluating the program, as we argue in Section~\ref{section:methodology}. In this Appendix, we thoroughly describe the characteristics and costs of the childcare centers providing alternative treatment, in order to create a comparison with the treatments offered by ABC and CARE.\\

\noindent Most of the families in the ABC and CARE control groups enrolled their children in alternative preschool that received federal subsidies and, therefore, were regulated by the Federal Interagency of Day Care Requirements (FIDCR). Figure~\ref{fig:ccabc} and Figure~\ref{fig:cccare} show the amount of enrollment into subsidized and non-subsidized care for ABC and CARE, respectively. Subsidized centers were required to have trained staff who were able to implement curricula designed to enhance cognitive, social, and linguistic competence in disadvantaged children.\footnote{\citet{Burchinal_etal_1989_CD_Daycare-Pre-K-Dev}.} Thus, we consider these centers to offer high-quality center-based childcare.

	\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Regulation}

\noindent During the ABC and CARE programs, North Carolina had an active, high-quality system of public childcare for vulnerable families funded by several public programs. Examples include Title IV-A of the Social Service Administration (SSA), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and Title IV-B of Child Welfare Services. These funding efforts were amplified in 1975 by Title XX of the SSA, Social Services Block Grant, which was the main federal source of childcare financing in the US when ABC was active.\footnote{\citet{Robins_1988_Federal-Child-Care}.}\\

\noindent Federally funded childcare services were regulated according to FIDCR standards, which defined stringent regulation for center-based programs for children between the ages of 3 and 6.\footnote{\citet{Department-of-Health_1968_DayCareRequirements}.} These requirements were enforced and childcare providers were aware of them.\footnote{\citet{Kuperman_2015_Clifford-Russell-Interview}.} Additionally, North Carolina had a mandatory licensing law for childcare facilities. This regulation only applied to centers serving children below the age of 3 while FIDCR applied to centers for older children (between the ages of 3 and 6). The relative weakness of this regulation is not very relevant for our study because treatment substitution occurred mostly after age 3.\footnote{\citet{NCGA_1971_House-Bill-100}.} Table~\ref{table:staff} compares a widely-used quality standard, the child-staff ratio, between the North Carolina and FIDCR standards and the actual ABC and CARE numbers.

\subsubsection{Costs}
% Need citations
\noindent Previous papers have used childcare cost rates that are not specific to North Carolina and do not account for the contemporaneous structure of the subsidies. We use the local subsidy rates that were in place when the ABC subjects were in preschool to impute different costs of the alternative preschools. These costs depend on the specific preschool attended and the eligibility of the families to receive the subsidies. \\

\noindent When ABC was in operation, center-based childcare was subsidized by several federal programs (the Department of Social Services categorized these programs as Child Welfare, AFDC, and Work Incentive Programs).\footnote{\citet{NC-State-Dept_1972_Licensed-Day-Care}.} However, our calculations of the cost of alternative preschool is simplified by the fact that the subsidies were centralized and regulated by the County Department of Social Services. Those departments used a uniform subsidy rate, regardless of the origin of the funds.\footnote{\citet{Ad-Hoc-NC_1974_Letter}.} We collected information about the subsidy rate at the time, which approximates the price of the centers, as centers pegged their fees and services to the maximum subsidy rate. Moreover, we know which centers each ABC control subject attended. We interviewed North Carolina childcare staff and academics that study childcare to document which of those centers were subsidized and regulated at the time.\footnote{\citet{Kuperman_2015_Clifford-Russell-Interview,Kuperman-Hojman_2015_Hodgers-Interview}.} For subsidized centers, we impute the maximum Department of Social Services fee established at the time: \$633/month in 2014 USD.\footnote{\citet{Ad-Hoc-NC_1974_Letter,Comm-Plan-Serv_1973_Durhams-Share}.} For non-subsidized centers, we impute the mean of costs for Level-1 centers (minimum accepted quality level) according to a 1982 North Carolina study of the cost of childcare: \$298/month in 2014 USD.\footnote{\citet{NC-Admin-Branch_1982_Day-Care-Cost-Study}.} Although the information in this survey is not ideal to assess the cost of subsidized preschools, as the subsidies greatly changed after the end of FIDCR (1981), it provides an approximation for assessing the cost of the non-subsidized centers. \\

\noindent Finally, we determine if the families paid the costs themselves or if they were subsidized, in which case we also add deadweight costs. We consider if a subject was eligible for subsidies if the family lived in poverty according to the federal guidelines and all parents living at home worked. If a family is deemed eligible, then we assume the child's preschool was fully subsidized using the rates described above without additional subsidies. \\

\subsection{Data} \label{appendix:data}

In Table~\ref{tab:ecvars_1} through Table~\ref{tab:adultvars_2}, we summarize the data availability for both ABC and CARE. The data collection processes in both programs were analogous by design. For both programs, the treatment and control groups were followed into adulthood with relatively low attrition. For ABC, subjects were followed annually through elementary school and at ages 12, 15, 21, and 30. Health and administrative crime data were collected when the subjects reached their mid-30s. For CARE, the exact same follow-ups are available with the exception of the age 15 follow-up.\\

Note: This plot shows the number of participants in ABC for whom there exists data at the periods of data collection by experimental group.

The numbers in the bars indicate the number of individuals who were interviewed during that phase of data collection.

\end{comment}

\noindent Attrition was low in ABC. Information is available on 100 subjects in the age 30 follow-up, which we call the adult follow-up. In addition, 80 subjects---40 from the control group and 40 from the treatment group---consented to the release of their criminal records. Further, 70 participants consented to the release of information regarding a full-range biomedical panel---31 from the control group and 39 from the treatment group. \\

\noindent Attrition was also low for CARE subjects. Information is available on 58 subjects (more than 85\% of the initial sample) in the age-30 follow-up. Additionally, 40 participants (11 from the control group, 18 from the family education group, and 11 from the center-based childcare and family education group) released information on the full-range biomedical sweep. Administrative crime data are not available for CARE. We do not evaluate the second-phase of treatment in CARE because it was not randomized. Rather, those in the center-based childcare and family education group and the family education group were offered school-age treatment, and those in the control group were not.  \\

\noindent In the following set of tables (Table~\ref{tab:abc_baseline} through Table~\ref{tab:health_baseline}), we compare the observed, baseline characteristics between the first-phase control and treatment groups in ABC, which are the main groups we analyze, at different stages of the data collection follow-ups. For each observed characteristic, we present the bootstrapped $p$-value associated with the standard $t$-test. We also present the bootstrapped, step-down $p$-value on jointly testing the difference in observed characteristics across the two blocks of variables separated by the horizontal line.\footnote{\citet{Lehmann_Romano_2005_testing}.}\\

\noindent Despite some exceptions, these tables indicate balance between the treatment and control groups from the first-phase randomization, which is the primary comparison we analyze in the main paper. The balance in observed characteristics holds for the different samples we consider, which differs from the initial sample due to various instances of item non-response. For the second-phase randomization, there is also balance in observed characteristics. \\

\noindent Table \ref{tab:care_baseline2} through Table \ref{tab:health_baseline_care_t1} are the analogous tables for CARE. We compare the two treatment groups (center-based childcare and family education, and only family education) separately across the full sample and by cohort. The inference statistics are constructed using the same methods as for Table \ref{tab:abc_baseline} through Table \ref{tab:health_baseline}. \\

\section{Background Variables and Tested Outcomes} \label{appendix:controls}

\subsection{Controlling for Background Variables}

\noindent We select the background variables that we control for as follows. First, we select the three variables, from 17 potential variables, that best predict enrollment into alternative preschool for subjects who were randomly assigned not to receive center-based childcare---the control group in ABC and the control and family education treatment groups in CARE. To choose the most predictive control set, we estimate the $17 \choose 3$ linear models, using the variables in Panels (1) and (2) of Table~\ref{tab:pselectvars}. The most predictive model is the one generating the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).\\

\noindent We proceed in a similar way to choose the second set of background variables. Instead of predicting enrollment into alternative preschool, we predict the relevant outcome of interest. For this exercise we use the variables in Panel (2), so we estimate $14 \choose 3$ models.\\

\noindent Our set of control variables consists of these two sets of background variables.

\section{Results} \label{appendix:results}

\noindent In this appendix we present the treatment effects estimates of the center-based treatment in ABC and CARE. For each set of estimates, we first present a summary of the effect of the program(s) using a combining function counting the number of socially positive treatment effects. We then present tables of treatment effect estimates for each outcome. Finally, we present the treatment effect estimates using the step-down procedure to test multiple hypotheses. \\

\noindent We analyze 95 outcomes when combining the ABC and CARE samples. Table~\ref{table:abccare_rslt_pooled_counts} shows that across all methods of estimation, pooling males and females, over 70\% of the treatment effect estimates are socially positive. When conditioning on 10\% statistical significance, almost 40\% of all estimates are socially positive. These statistics allow us to reject the hypothesis that the treatment and control groups have the same marginal distributions in outcomes. \\

\noindent For both males and females, we find positive effects in IQ test scores, achievement test scores, as well as educational attainment. Males also enjoy additional benefits in the areas of employment, labor earnings, and hypertension. \\

\noindent In each of the tables for combining functions and treatment effect estimates, we present 8 different estimates. Column (1) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to. Column (2) adjusts the estimates in (1) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (3) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, restricting the latter to subjects who did not receive preschool alternatives. Column (4) adjusts the estimates in (3) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (5) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, placing a relatively high weight on the subjects who are likely not to be enrolled in alternative preschools. Column (6) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, restricting the latter to subjects who received preschool alternatives. Column (7) adjusts the estimates in (6) for attrition and controls for a set of covariates. Column (8) corresponds to the mean difference between the groups randomly assigned to receive center-based childcare and the groups randomly assigned not to, placing a relatively high weight on the children who are likely to be enrolled in alternative preschools. The results in bold are significant at the 10\% level in a single-sided, non-parametric, bootstrapped test. \\

\section{Alternative Evaluation Methodologies} \label{appendix:amethodology}

\noindent In the main paper, we develop and document the results from two methodologies to account for treatment substitution in the first phases of ABC and CARE. The objective of each method is to estimate the average treatment effect of ABC and CARE, holding fixed take-up of alternative preschool by the control groups. We want to construct a scenario in which the subjects in the control group do not attend alternative preschool. This allows us to evaluate center-based childcare relative to a counterfactual scenario in which subjects stay at home.\\

\noindent This section presents alternative methodologies to evaluate the first-phase treatment. Throughout the rest of this section, we refer to treatment in either ABC or CARE generically as center-based childcare, as we discard the family education treatment group of CARE---as in the main paper, the control group consists of the control groups in both ABC and CARE. We refer to take-up of treatment substitution as enrollment into alternative preschool. As in our main methodology, we choose the control sets to account for background variables using the method in Appendix~\ref{appendix:controls}.\\

\noindent To illustrate the alternative methodologies, we present results for a small set of outcomes. First, we consider a time series of IQ scores. Second, we present results for three long-term outcomes: years of education, employment, and labor income. Both IQ scores and the chosen long-term outcomes follow predictable patterns and are straightforward to interpret. These characteristics allow us to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated treatment effects using the different strategies.\\

\noindent Let the discrete choice to enroll in alternative preschool, $P(\omega)$, be defined as $P(\omega)=\mathbf{1}\left[V(\omega)>0\right]$ which is an indicator equal to 1 when the subject is enrolled. Let $Q(\omega)$, the number of months in alternative preschool, be defined as $V(\omega)T$. $\mathbf{X}(\omega)$ is a vector of observed individual- or household-level characteristics. $P(\omega)$ and $Q(\omega)$ are zero for participants of the treatment group. In this section, we allow for the take-up of the program to be imperfectly given by the randomization. Let $D(\omega)$ be take-up of the ABC or CARE program.

\subsection{Instrumental Variables}

\noindent The first alternative method we present is based on a standard, linear instrumental variable framework.

\subsubsection{Model and Conditions}

\noindent Consider the following equation for an outcome $Y(\omega)$:


\begin{equation}
Y(\omega) = \alpha^D D(\omega) + \alpha^Q Q(\omega) + \mathbf{X}(\omega) \beta + \varepsilon(\omega),
\label{eq:ivnot}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $D(\omega)$ and $Q(\omega)$ are endogenous. Selection into treatment or alternative preschool is likely correlated with characteristics not observed when estimating the coefficients characterizing the outcome equation, i.e., $Cov(D(\omega),\varepsilon(\omega)) \neq 0$ and $Cov(Q(\omega),\varepsilon(\omega)) \neq 0$. Estimating the coefficients in \eqref{eq:ivnot} by OLS yields inconsistent estimates.\\

\noindent A standard solution is to introduce a vector of instrumental variables, $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$, satisfying two conditions: (i) the matrix $\Pi$ of the coefficients in the population regression of $D(\omega)$ and $Q(\omega)$ on $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$ is full rank; and (ii) $\mathbf{Z}(\omega)$ is uncorrelated with $\varepsilon(\omega)$.


\subsubsection{Instrumental Variables in Practice}

\noindent To identify the coefficients in \eqref{eq:ivnot} using an instrumental variable strategy we need at least two instruments. We use randomization into ABC or CARE treatment as an instrument, denoted as an indicator, $R(\omega)$. We then consider up to three other instruments.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \textit{Season of subject's birth}. This variable is coded as an indicator for being born in the fall (born between June and November). If preschools accepted children primarily in the fall, then children born in the fall could enter preschool when they were younger. Although there is evidence in the economics literature that being born during specific times in the year can influence a child's outcomes, the main channel for this effect seems to be the disproportionate selection into season of birth by high-income mothers \citep{Buckles-Hungerman_2013_RES}. Given that the mothers were very young and disadvantaged in the ABC and CARE samples, we assume that a negligible proportion of them selected their quarter of birth.

\item \textit{Presence of a grandmother in the county}. We hypothesize that the grandmothers of the subjects, who in this sample are relatively young and still working, could help the study mothers take care of their children. We assume that the mothers would have less influence over the presence of a grandmother in the county as opposed to the presence of a grandmother living in the home. We also assume that the grandmothers do not affect the subjects differently than any other avenue of informal care, such as care from a neighbor. In practice, the presence of a grandmother has a positive effect on preschool attendance, which could indicate that they helped take the subject to preschool. This variable is only available for ABC.

\item \textit{Number of relatives living in the household apart from the mother, subject, siblings, and male partner}. We assume that the relatives could take care of the subject while the mother was at work or in school, but that they do not affect the subjects differently than any other avenue of informal care. In practice, having additional relatives living at home decreases the probability that the subject goes into preschool.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sets of Instruments}
\noindent We consider three combinations of the instruments.  All of them include randomization into center-based treatments and birth in the fall. All of them include at least one variable representing access to informal care from relatives. The sets are the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Randomization, Born in the Fall, Grandmother in County, Number of Relatives at Home
\item Randomization, Born in the Fall, Grandmother in County
\item Randomization, Born in the Fall, Number of Relatives at Home
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Specifications for the Instruments}
\noindent We test various specifications in which we allow for interactions of the potential instruments with the first-phase randomization indicator. In particular, we test three specifications for our instruments:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Instruments measured in levels: $ \left( R(\omega),\mathbf{Z}(\omega) \right) $.
\item\label{interact} Instruments measured in levels and interactions of treatment with the instruments and the controls: $ \left(R(\omega),\mathbf{Z}(\omega),\mathbf{Z}(\omega)R(\omega),\mathbf{X}(\omega)R(\omega) \right)$.
\item\label{inverse} Interactions of the instruments and the controls with an indicator for being randomized into the control group: $\left( R(\omega), \mathbf{X}(\omega) \left( 1-R(\omega) \right), \mathbf{Z}(\omega) \left( 1-R(\omega) \right) \right)$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent In practice, the specification in \eqref{inverse} is the most stable across outcomes. This makes economic sense because the instruments are less likely to affect the participants of the treatment group, given that almost all the treatment families comply to the first-phase randomization protocol.

\subsubsection{Functional Forms of Enrollment in Alternative Preschool}

\noindent We use a different parameterization of enrollment into alternative preschool in \eqref{eq:ivnot}:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The number of months in alternative preschool, $Q(\omega)$.
\item An indicator for take-up of alternative preschool, $P(\omega)$.
\item The $\log$ of months in alternative preschool, $\log Q(\omega)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

\noindent In this section, we present the results of the instrumental variable approach. We discuss the estimates of the coefficient for $D(\omega)$ in \eqref{eq:ivnot}, while accounting for endogenous take-up of alternative preschool. The results are roughly stable for all presented outcomes: the effect considering the take-up of alternative preschool in the control group is much stronger than the intent-to-treat effect (the mean difference between the treatment and control groups). At ages 15 and 21, the effects on IQ scores are close to zero.

\subsubsection{Main Specification}

\noindent Our main specification uses three instruments: randomization into center-based childcare in either ABC or CARE, the presence of a grandmother in the county, and being born in the fall. We interact the latter two instrument with an indicator for being randomized into the control group ($1-R(\omega)$). The endogenous variables are $D(\omega)$ and $Q(\omega)$.\\

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:main_iv1} and Figure~\ref{fig:mainiv2} display the estimates of the coefficient of $D(\omega)$. That is, the effect of attending the ABC or CARE treatment, fixing take-up of alternative preschool. The results indicate the following: (i) the effects are stronger compared to those in the main paper, even compared to those in the main paper that fix subjects to no preschool alternatives; (ii) the estimates are less stable across ages compared to those in the main paper. For example, while the effects on IQ scores from ages 0 to 5 average around 14 points in the main paper, they average 20 points using this specification of instrumental variables.

\subsubsection{Varying the Sets of Instruments}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:ins_inter_Q_iv1} and Figure \ref{fig:ins_inter_Q_iv2} explore the sensitivity of the estimates to different sets of instruments. The pattern of results indicates that the method is generally robust to the three sets of instrumental variables that we consider.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Varying the Specification of the Instruments}

\noindent We now present an exercise to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to different specifications of the instrumental variables. First, Figure~\ref{fig:nointer_Q_iv} and Figure~\ref{fig:nointer_Q_other} present the results using the set of instruments that are not interacted with an indicator for randomization into the control group ($1-R(\omega)$). Figure~\ref{fig:inter_Q_iv} and Figure~\ref{fig:inter_Q_other} present results not only interacting the instruments but also interacting the observed characteristics we control for. In both exercises, we use $Q(\omega)$ as the endogenous variable, along with $D(\omega)$.\\

\noindent The results follow the same patterns as before, although they change when the instruments are not interacted. This makes economic sense because the interacted instruments better represent the economic intuition we offer before: the instruments other than $R(\omega)$ are more likely to shift the decisions of the families of the control-group subjects compared to those of the treatment-group subjects.

\subsubsection{Varying the Parameterization of Alternative Preschool Take-up}

\noindent Now, we explore the sensitivity to the specification of $Q(\omega)$ in \eqref{eq:ivnot}. We consider two alternatives. First, we use an indicator of take-up of alternative preschool, $P(\omega)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:ins_inter_P_iv} and Figure~\ref{fig:ins_inter_P_other}). Second, we take the $\log$ of $Q(\omega)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:ins_inter_LogQ_iv} and Figure~\ref{fig:ins_inter_LogQ_other}).

\subsection{Control Functions}

\noindent We now consider a control function approach. With control functions, the objective is also to simultaneously account for take-up of center-based childcare and alternative preschool.

\subsubsection{Setup}

\noindent The method we propose is an application of the selection correction in \citet{Heckman_1979_Econometrica}. We model the selection into both endogenous variables of interest, center-based childcare and alternative preschool. The method involves three equations: (i) the outcome equation; (ii) the probability of participating in center-based childcare; (iii) a linear equation describing the number of months enrolled in preschool alternatives.\\

\noindent Let $Y^{0}(\omega)$ be the counterfactual outcome of subject $i$ when not participating in center-based childcare. Similarly, let $Y^{1}(\omega)$ be her potential outcome if she participates. We model the outcome as:

\begin{eqnarray}
Y^1(\omega) &=& \alpha^1+\mathbf{X}(\omega) \mathbf{\beta}                 +\varepsilon^1(\omega) \nonumber  \\
Y^0(\omega) &=& \alpha^0+\mathbf{X}(\omega) \mathbf{\beta} + \alpha^Q Q(\omega)+\varepsilon^0(\omega).  \label{eq:potout}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent The equation describing participation in center-based childcare is:

\begin{equation}
D(\omega) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
        	0 &\text{if } D(\omega)^* \leq  0 \\
            1 &\text{if } D(\omega)^* > 0, \label{eq:sel1}
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation}

\noindent where we interpret $D(\omega)^*$ as a latent continuous variable representing the household's interest in sending the subject to treatment. We write

\begin{equation}
D^{*}(\omega) = \mathbf{W}(\omega) \gamma^{D} + \varepsilon^{D}(\omega), \label{eq:probitD}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{W}(\omega)$ is a vector that includes $\mathbf{X}(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ and can include variables that shift the decision to enroll subjects into ABC or CARE without shifting the counterfactual outcome of interest, $Y^{d}(\omega)$. \\

\noindent We model the selection into months of alternative preschool as a linear equation with fixed coefficients, assuming homogeneous treatment effects:

\begin{equation}
Q(\omega) = \mathbf{W}(\omega) \gamma^{Q} + \varepsilon^{Q}(\omega), \label{eq:selq}
\end{equation}

\noindent In general, the unobserved variables in each of these equations are correlated. We assume that they are distributed as follows:

\begin{equation}
        \left[ \begin{array}{l}
        	 \varepsilon(\omega)^1 \\
            \varepsilon(\omega)^0 \\
            \varepsilon(\omega)^D
        \end{array} \right]  \sim \mathcal{N} \left[ \left( \begin{array}{l}
        	 0 \\
           0 \\
           0
        \end{array} \ \right),
                \left( \begin{array}{llll}
        	 \sigma_{1}^2 & \sigma_{1,0} & \sigma_{1,D}   \\
             \sigma_{1,0} & \sigma_{0}^2 & \sigma_{0,D}   \\
             \sigma_{1,D} & \sigma_{0,D} & 1
        \end{array} \right) \right],  \label{eq:udist}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we normalize $\var \left( \varepsilon^D(\omega) \right) =1$.\\

\noindent Further, we assume that
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon(\omega)^0|D(\omega)=0,\mathbf{W}(\omega),\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega),Q(\omega)=q\right]=\sigma^{0,Q}\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega)+\mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon(\omega)^0|D(\omega)=0,\mathbf{W}(\omega)\right].
\label{eq:E[epsilon0]}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Identification}

\noindent The following steps identify the parameters of interest. First, we estimate the parameters characterizing the decision to enroll the subject in center-based childcare. We exploit the assumption that $\varepsilon(\omega)^D \sim \mathcal{N} \left( 0, 1 \right)$ in \eqref{eq:udist} and estimate the parameters in \eqref{eq:probitD} using a probit model.\\

\noindent Second, we approximate the unobserved term relevant to the choice of $Q(\omega)$. We take the coefficients in \eqref{eq:selq} to obtain an estimate for $\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega)$. By linearly conditioning on this term, we account for the correlation between the error term in the decision for $Q(\omega)$ and the error term in the outcome equation, $\varepsilon(\omega)^0$.\\

\noindent Third, we estimate the coefficients in the outcome equation using the proxies for the unobserved components. We rewrite \eqref{eq:potout} using conditional expectations:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbb{E}\left[Y(\omega)^1|D(\omega)=1,\mathbf{W}(\omega)\right]                         &=& \alpha^1+\mathbf{X}(\omega)\mathbf{\beta}              +\mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon(\omega)^1|D(\omega)=1,\mathbf{W}(\omega)      \right] \nonumber \\
\mathbb{E}\left[Y(\omega)^0|D(\omega)=0,\mathbf{W}(\omega),\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega),Q(\omega)=q\right] &=& \alpha^0+\mathbf{X}(\omega)\mathbf{\beta} +\alpha^Q q \label{eq:condout} \\ \nonumber && \quad + \mathbb{E}\left[\varepsilon(\omega)^0|D(\omega)=0,\mathbf{W}(\omega),\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega),Q(\omega)=q\right].
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Once we condition on the proxy for $\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega)$, the error term in the outcome equations only depends on the selection into center-based childcare. The conditional error terms in \eqref{eq:condout} can be specified using control functions.\\

\noindent For subjects enrolled in treatment, the control function is:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[\varepsilon(\omega)^1|D(\omega)=1,\mathbf{W}(\omega) \right]=\sigma_1\frac{\phi \left( \mathbf{W}(\omega) \gamma^D \right) }{ \Phi \left( \mathbf{W}(\omega) \gamma^D \right) }. \label{eq:contam}
\end{equation}

\noindent For subjects not enrolled in the treatment, the control function is:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \left[\varepsilon(\omega)^0|D(\omega)=0,\mathbf{W}(\omega),\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega),Q(\omega)=q\right]= \sigma^{0,Q}\varepsilon^{Q}(\omega) - \sigma_0 \frac{\phi\left(\mathbf{W}(\omega)\gamma^D\right)}{\Phi\left( - \mathbf{W}(\omega) \gamma^D \right) }. \label{eq:home}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Estimates}

\noindent By including the control functions, we can recover consistent estimates of the parameters in \eqref{eq:potout} through a linear regression. The effect of center-based childcare is the difference of the intercepts in the two outcome equations.\\

\noindent The charts below present the estimates for the parameter associated with $D(\omega)$. That is, the effect of participating in center-based childcare relative to a counterfactual of receiving no preschool alternative. As before, we present results for IQ scores at different ages and for a set of relevant adult outcomes. The results are not compelling, as they present irregularities over the life cycle that differ from the rest of results we present in the main paper and throughout this appendix.

\section{Assessing Common Critiques to ABC} \label{appendix:assessingcc}

\noindent This section of the appendix assesses some of the critiques to ABC, which could apply to CARE as well. The critiques focus on the first phase of the program, to which we refer simply as ABC in this section of the appendix. We consider the following categories of critiques: (i) validity of treatment effects given early differences between treatment and control groups, (ii) fadeout of the treatment effect on cognitive outcomes, and (iii) compromised randomization. \\

\subsection{Treatment Effects vs. Early Differences Between Groups}

\noindent The first critique we assess is that of \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. The author asks if ABC prevented socio-cultural mental retardation. He focuses on different measures of cognition, and generically calls them IQ. His main focus is on the raw mean difference between the treatment and the control groups in the Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Infant Behavior (BSID) at 1 year of age.\footnote{The Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) is a standard measure of cognition at taken between ages 0 and 2 \citep{Childrens-Health_2016_Bayley-Scales}.} He finds a noticeable disparity in the mean difference between cohorts 1 and 2 and cohorts 3 and 4, as early as six months after the treatment began. As \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} argues, this difference, displayed in Table~\ref{table:cohorts}, is conspicuous. Importantly, the author fails to note that the mean differences have noticeably high standard errors.

\input{output/abc_cohorts}

\noindent \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} states that ``an essential question is whether the differences at 6 months of age were due to the intervention or were preexisting'' \citep[][p. 230]{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation} proceeds with speculative exercises that lead him to state that it is questionable to conclude that the mean difference between the treatment and control groups as early as 6 months of age is a consequence of the treatment.\footnote{The exact quote is: ``Even if the differences between experimental and control groups at 6 months of age were a consequence of the first few months of intervention, which is questionable, the negligible additional effects after age 4.5 more years in the program should at least make one cautious about this kind of intervention's potential [\ldots]'' \citep[][p. 235]{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}. We assess the former point before getting to the latter.}\\

\noindent His argument stems from not receiving information on the maternal characteristics, which he considers fundamental for his analysis to comparing test scores over the years.\footnote{He does not note that tests scores \textit{do not have a well-defined scale} and are hard to compare.}\\

\noindent We present some annotations with respect to the comments in \citet{Spitz_1992_ABC-Retardation}.\\

\noindent \textbf{1. Mothers do not significantly differ in observed characteristics between the treatment and the control groups in any ABC cohort.} When jointly testing the hypothesis of differences in a battery of observed characteristics, we fail to reject any difference between the families of the subjects (see Table~\ref{tab:baseline_coh1} to Table~\ref{tab:baseline_coh4}). Even when the point estimates present some differences, they are minimal. For example, treatment-group mothers differ from control-group mothers, on average, by having one point higher IQ score (the population standard deviation is 15 points).\\

\noindent \textbf{2. Other early childhood education programs have generated gains in cognition very early in life, as soon as a year after the start of the program.} A more recent program, the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), treated children from ages 0 to 3. \citet{Gross_Spiker_etal_1997_BOOKHelpinglowbirth} thoroughly describe this program. A lot of its elements were based on ABC and CARE. The program offered, on average, eight hours a week of center-based childcare from ages 1 to 3, weekly home visits from ages 0 to 1, and bi-monthly home visits from ages 1 to 3. Measures of the Bayley MDI at 12 and 24 months are available. The most intensive part of the treatment, center-based childcare, began in IHDP at 12 months of age while it began in ABC at birth. As in ABC, after a few months of center-based childcare, the effects on cognition were substantial in IHDP.

\input{output/ihdp_bayley}

\noindent \textbf{3. The effects on cognition are sustained throughout childhood and up to age 21 even when partialing out the Bayley MDI at ages 12 and 24 months.} When partialing out from a linear regression the score in the Bayley MDI tests both at 12 and 24 months of age, the treatment effects on cognition, measured by the mean difference in IQ scores at different ages between the treatment and control groups, are still significant and are sustained up to age 21 (see Figure~\ref{fig:treatiqsabc}).

\begin{figure}[H]
		\caption{Treatment Effects on IQ, ABC} \label{fig:treatiqsabc}
		\includegraphics[width=.9\columnwidth]{output/abc_mdifixing_2.eps}
\floatfoot{
\footnotesize
\noindent Note: This figure displays the mean difference in IQ scores at different ages between the treatment and control groups, pooling males and females. The line with circles represents the raw difference. The line with squares represents the difference when linearly controlling for the Bayley Mental Development Index at 12 and 24 months.}
\end{figure}

\noindent The author raises an additional concern. He states that even if the early-life effects on the Bayley MDI were valid, the effects were not long-lasting. When doing so, he exclusively refers to the effects the program had on cognition. As we document throughout the main paper, however, ABC had effects on a wide set of life-cycle outcomes, which perhaps are more important than the effects on cognition if measured by the economic gains they generate. Examples include: employment at age 30 for males, high-school graduation for females, and a variety of health measures at age 34 for males. We document these effects in the main paper.\\

\subsection{Fadeout of Treatment Effects}

\noindent This sustained effect on life-cycle outcomes relates to another category of criticism of ABC---the fadeout of treatment effects after the actual treatment period.\footnote{See, for example, \citet{Besharov-etal_2011_ABCProject}.} Based on the fadeout of the effects on cognition and age-21 outcomes, some studies claim that ABC had no sustained long-term effects. In addition to the evidence we cite above, it is important to add the following.\\

\noindent  \textbf{4. The treatment effects of ABC differed by gender.} For example, we find substantial effects on employment for males and high-school graduation for females. This does not mean that the program did not work. It means that market conditions could have affected the way in which the treated subjects benefited from the program's effects.\\

\subsection{Compromised Randomization}

\noindent The third and last critique we assess is that of compromised randomization.\footnote{See for example \citet{Baumeister-Bacharach_2000_Early-Generic} and the multiple studies cited there.} The main critique to the program in this respect is that seven children in the treatment group did not comply to their initial assignment and one subject switched from control to treatment status (see Table~\ref{table:abccompromises}, which we reproduce from the main paper). Although we document more cases of compromised randomization, we start by assessing these eight cases.\footnote{Our main methodology assesses all the cases except the four subjects for whom we do not have data at all. We are not able to account for them because our method is based on observing at least some baseline characteristics. See Section~\ref{section:methodology} in the main paper for more details.}\\

\noindent First, we propose a method to assess the non-compliance of six subjects for whom we have data available from ages 0 to 8. This allows for the possibility of adjusting the mean difference between the treatment and the control groups, using a standard Bloom estimator \citep{Bloom_1984_ER}. This estimator accounts for compliance, by weighting the mean difference by a measure of the probability of compliance. It takes the following form:

\begin{equation}
\Delta^{\textbf{Bloom}} = \frac{\mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ Y | R = 0 \right] }{\mathbb{E} \left[ D | R = 1 \right] - \mathbb{E} \left[ D | R = 0 \right]},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R$ indicates randomization into treatment, $D$ indicates treatment take-up, and $Y$ is an outcome of interest.\\

\noindent This estimator coincides with the instrumental variable estimator of the parameter in a linear regression of an outcome on a single explanatory variable, e.g. treatment take-up. As \citet{Angrist_Imbens_ea_1996_JASA} show, under certain assumptions it can be interpreted as the average treatment effect for those individuals induced to take up treatment by the instrument. This interpretation has various weaknesses \citep{Heckman_Urzua_etal_2006_REStat,Heckman_Urzua_2010_JoE}.\\

\noindent To compare the mean difference and the Bloom estimator we consider two measures of cognition, which are commonly used when evaluating ABC and are available for these six subjects: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale at age 3 and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at age 5. Table~\ref{table:nc1} presents the results and shows that the differences are minimal. \textbf{5. Adjusting for the non-compliance of these six subjects makes little difference} when assessing outcomes that we observe for these subjects.

\input{output/abc_noncomp_e1}

\noindent Second, we propose a method to account for non-compliance of the four subjects for whom we have no data at all. We reproduce the estimates in Table~\ref{table:nc2}, assigning the lowest score across all the subjects in the treatment group to each of these four children. For each of the tests we consider, the lowest score was 71 for both the age-3 and the age-5 measures. \textbf{6. Even when assigning the lowest score to the subjects who did not comply to treatment and for whom no data are available, the mean difference between treatment and control is sizable and not significantly different from the baseline cases where we do not adjust for non-compliance cases} (columns (1) and (3) in Table~\ref{table:nc1}).

\input{output/abc_noncomp_e2}

\noindent Finally, we note that our methodology in Section~\ref{section:methodology} and the results we present in Section~\ref{section:results} account for the remainder of randomization compromises, as when the families moved or abandoned the study later on. \textbf{7. The results are not greatly sensitive to adjusting for the rest of the randomization compromises}, as we show in Section~\ref{section:results}.

\section{Calculating the Benfit-to-cost Ratio and the IRR}

\noindent We estimate the benefit-to-cost ratio and the  internal rate of return of participation in ABC and CARE for the \textit{average participant} of the program. Let $B_{r,t}$ denote benefits and  $C_{r,t}$ denote costs for group $r$ at age $t$. Then $r$ takes either two values, $0$ for children randomized into the control group or $1$ for children randomized into the treatment group.\\

\noindent Both $B_{r,t}$ and $C_{r,t}$ are in 2014 USD and discounted to $t = 0$. Thus, the benefits $B_t = B_{1,t} - B_{0,t}$ and costs $C_t = C_{1,t} - C_{0,t}$ associated with program participation are the differences between the counter-factual benefits and costs. We use the counter-factual notation for costs because the costs for the control group are not zero: the control group children received some services from the ABC and CARE centers and some attended alternative care programs. \\

\noindent The estimate for the benefit-to-cost ratio is
\begin{align}
\mathbf{E} \left( \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^T B_t}{\sum_{t=0}^T C_t} \right).
\end{align}

\noindent The estimate for the internal rate of return is the value $\rho$ that solves:

\begin{align}
\sum_{t=0}^T \frac{ \mathbf{E} (B_t - C_t)}{(1+\rho)^t} = 0.
\end{align}

\section{Accounting for Attrition} \label{appendix:attrition}

\noindent We use a standard inverse probability weighting (IPW) scheme based on a logit model that predicts attrition using baseline characteristics.\footnote{\citet{Horvitz_Thompson_1952_JASA}.} We detail the identification of this scheme below. We describe our model selection process and the selected logit models in Tables \ref{table:nonipw}--\ref{table:ms_attrit_pooled} in Appendix \ref{app:method_identify}. We use the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to select the model with the best predictive ability. We use the same notation as in Section~\ref{section:cbamethodology} and a vector of background characteristics used in the randomization protocol; $W$ are background characteristics not used in this protocol.\\

\noindent Formally, let $A=1$ denote the case where we observe $Y$ and $A=0$ denote otherwise. We assume $A$ is independent of $Y$ conditional on $Z$, $R$, $X$, and $W$. Thus,

\begin{assumption} \label{ass:attr}
	\begin{align*}
		A \independent Y | W, Z, X, R.
	\end{align*}
\end{assumption}

\noindent Based on this assumption, we identify $\mathbb{E}[Y_r]$ as follows:

\begin{align} \label{eq:case2}
\mathbb{E}[Y_r] & = \int y f_{Y_r|Z}(y) f_Z(z) dydz \\ \nonumber
	           & = \int y f_{Y|Z,R=r}(y) f_Z(z) dydz \\ \nonumber
				& = \int y f_{Y|R=r,W,Z,X}(y) f_{W,X|R=r}(w,x) f_Z(z) dydxdwdz \\ \nonumber
				& = \int y f_{Y|R=r,W,Z,X,A=1}(y) f_{W,X|R=r,Z}(w,x) f_Z(z) dydxdwdz
\end{align}
\noindent where each component of \eqref{eq:case2} is straightforward to recover from the data. Using Bayes' Theorem, we can write an equivalent expression to make the IPW scheme explicit. That is, we apply Bayes' Theorem to $f_{W,X|R=r,Z}(w,x)$ and $f_Z(z)$ to obtain

\begin{equation*}
f_{W,X|R=r,Z}(w,x) = \frac{f_{W,X|R=r,Z,A=1}(w,x) P(A=1|R=r,Z)}{P(A=1|R=r,W,Z,X)}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
	f_Z(z) = \frac{f_{Z|R=r,A=1}(z) P(R=r,A=1)}{P(R=r,A=1|Z)}.
\end{equation*}
\noindent Then, we substitute these expressions into \eqref{eq:case2} to get

\begin{align*} \label{eq:case2ipw}
\mathbb{E}[Y_r] & = \int y f_{Y,X,W,Z|R=r,A=1}(y,x,w,z) \frac{P(R=r,A=1) P(A=1|R=r,Z)}{P(R=r,A=1|Z) P(A=1|R=r,W,Z,X)} dydxdwdz \\
	            & = \int y f_{Y,X,W,Z|R=r,A=1}(y,x,w,z) \frac{P(R=r,A=1)}{P(R=r|Z) P(A=1|R=r,W,Z,X)} dydxdwdz. \\
\end{align*}

\noindent Assumption \ref{ass:attr} generalizes the matching assumption of \citet{Campbell_Conti_etal_2014_EarlyChildhoodInvestments}. It conditions not only on pre-program variables but on fully observed post-treatment variables, $X$. This enables us to account  for two types of selection:  (i) selection into treatment; and (ii) selection into item response. The corresponding sample estimator for $\mathbb{E}[Y_r]$ is

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}} y(\omega) a_{i} w_{i,r} \mathbf{1}(r_i = r)
\end{align*}
\noindent where $\mathcal{I}$ indexes the individuals in the sample, $a_i$ indicates whether we observe $Y$ for individual $i$, and

\begin{align*}
	w_{i,r} = \frac{1}{\pi_r(z_i) \alpha(r_i,w_i,z_i,x_i)} \frac{1}{\sum_k{\frac{\mathbf{1}(r_i = r) \mathbf{1}(a_i = 1)}{\pi_r(z_k)\alpha(r_k,w_k,z_k,x_k)}}},
\end{align*}
\noindent with $\pi_r(z) := P(R=r|Z=z)$ and $\alpha(r,w,z,x) := P(A=1|R=r,W=w,Z=z,X=x)$. The weight $\pi_r$ corrects for selection into treatment based on pre-program variables $Z$. The weight $\alpha$ corrects for item non-response based on $R, W, Z, X$. \\
